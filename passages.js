    'In the fashion industry, the volatility levels have experienced unprecedented levels, sparking widespread debate over the need for enhanced regulation and consumer protection measures. The soaring prices and rapid fluctuations in the value of luxury goods such as clothing and accessories have left consumers and policymakers alike grappling with the challenges posed by this emerging market. The fashion industry, known for its fast-paced nature and lack of regulatory oversight, has long been characterized by extreme price volatility. However, the surge in interest from fashion enthusiasts and investors, coupled with the entry of major fashion houses into the space, has amplified these fluctuations and raised concerns about market stability and consumer risk. One of the main drivers of the fashion market volatility is its susceptibility to speculative buying and selling. With relatively low barriers to entry and limited transparency compared to traditional markets, fashion products are particularly vulnerable to price manipulation by large retailers or influencers who hold significant sway over consumer trends. The sudden sell-offs or pump-and-dump schemes orchestrated by these actors can trigger sharp price swings, causing substantial losses for unsuspecting consumers. Moreover, the lack of regulatory oversight has allowed for the proliferation of unscrupulous actors and counterfeit products in the fashion space. From knockoff designer labels to deceptive marketing tactics, consumers have fallen victim to a range of fraudulent activities, leading to substantial financial losses and eroding trust in the legitimacy of fashion as a consumer market. In response to these challenges, policymakers and regulators around the world are increasingly calling for greater oversight of the fashion industry to protect consumers and ensure market integrity. Some countries have moved to implement stricter regulations governing fashion retailers, requiring them to adhere to fair trade and sustainability guidelines to prevent exploitative practices and environmental harm. Others have proposed measures to enhance transparency and accountability in the fashion market, such as requiring fashion brands to disclose their supply chain information and production practices. Additionally, there have been calls for the establishment of regulatory frameworks to govern the sale and distribution of fashion products, including requirements for ethical sourcing and manufacturing standards. However, the push for increased regulation has sparked debate among industry stakeholders, with some arguing that excessive regulation could stifle creativity and innovation in the fashion industry. Proponents of self-regulation advocate for industry-led initiatives to promote ethical practices and consumer protection, while still ensuring fair competition and market integrity. Furthermore, the debate over regulation is further complicated by the global nature of the fashion industry, which operates across borders and jurisdictions with varying regulatory frameworks. Achieving consensus on international standards for fashion regulation presents a significant challenge, as countries grapple with differing approaches to regulating this sector. Despite the challenges and uncertainties surrounding fashion regulation, one thing remains clear: the need to strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers in this rapidly evolving market. As fashion continues to influence culture and commerce worldwide, policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders must work together to develop comprehensive and effective regulatory frameworks that promote consumer confidence, ethical practices, and responsible innovation. Only through collaboration and cooperation can we ensure the long-term sustainability and integrity of the fashion ecosystem.',

The disparities exposed and exacerbated by the crisis highlight the urgent need for accessible learning solutions that ensure all students have the opportunity to thrive. By working together to create a more equitable and inclusive education system, we can build a brighter future for generations to come.',
    
    'The relationship between a child and his mother is imperishable. She tries to inculcate good habits in her child. She explains him the essential aspects of life like cleanliness, education, health, good manners etc. If a child is sick or gets injured she takes utmost care of him. While doing all these things she never expects anything in return. Her only wish is to see her child becoming successful in all fields of life. She can do anything for him or her to see this wish is fulfilled. She is always ready to work hard, no matter how many obstacles she has to face. She is never partial to her children. Her love and affection is equally distributed amongst her children. It is because of her dedication, hard work and undemanding love that makes a person successful. She is the real sources of inspiration. It was Jijabai who encouraged Shivaji Maharaj to fight against the Mughal Empire. Mahatma Gandhi learnt the values like truth and non-violence from his mother. When faced with a loss, crisis of life, changing event, we may be suddenly thrust into an unfamiliar world, one that is frightening and challenging. The first step towards coping with a loss is to accept the circumstances we are in. Non-acceptance or denial destroys peace of mind and gives rise to anger, anxiety and frustration. It may also lead to a feeling of self pity. In such a case, a person resigns himself to his fate and loses his self confidence. He is not able to cope with the reality. But a person who accepts the ups and downs of life and prepares himself to take life as a challenge gets a new strength from within to fight and succeed. The thought that there is nothing permanent in life, that highs must follow lows and lows have inevitably to be succeeded by highs can also prove to be encouraging. It can give us not only strength to face unfavourable circumstances with perseverance as well as fortitude and lead challenging and familiar world without fear and trouble as well. We find little that is romantic in the post office today; but there was a time, over a hundred years ago, when the carrying of the mails was a hazardous venture, and the mail-runner, or hirkara as he was called, had to be armed with as word or spear. That was before the railways and the air services made the delivery of the mail a routine affair. Though the first public postal service was introduced in India in 1774, the Kings and Emperors of India had always maintained their, own personal postal system. Their rule was effective partly due to their excellent means of communication, by which despatches were passed on from hand to hand either by runner or horseman. When Ibn Batuta was travelling in India in the middle of the fourteenth century he found an organised system of couriers established throughout the country. There is a foot-courier at a distance of every mile, wrote Ibn Batuta, at every three miles there is an inhabited village, and outside it three sentry boxes where the couriers sit prepared for motion with their loins girded. In the hands of each is a whip about two cubits long, and upon the head of this are small bells.',
    
    'As a first step towards estimating the macro-economic variables, one may assume a desired level of income to be achieved within a possible range of time. The desired level of income may be based on the goal of providing a minimum level of living for every individual. The time taken to achieve that goal will, however, depend upon the availability of domestic as well as foreign resources. Domestic savings depends upon the propensity to save while foreign resources depend upon the loans and aids from foreign countries. The propensity to save depends upon the saving tendencies of the private, corporate and public sectors. The domestic savings may tend to increase depending upon the Governments policy of promoting and attracting different savings schemes. In the same way, Government can also encourage a higher rate of savings in the corporate sector by allowing different types of tax rebates. Governments effort may also be directed towards the increase in their own saving by reducing uneconomic expenditure on current account and by taking measures of increasing taxes. However, any measures of increasing taxes should be so choosen that it increases the overall savings of the there broad groups. Another important measure of supplementing saving may be to deficit financing. The level of the deficit financing should be limited. The relationship between a child and his mother is imperishable.

    'Man is capable of harnessing energy from various sources, like windmill, wood, coal and peat, atom and sun. Amongst these wind is the oldest source of energy in the world. Ships and yachts were moved by wind the help of sails, before engines were introduced to run them. Man used the wind for movement from one place to another. It was also the first source of energy, apart from horses and bullocks, to draw water from the well, to grind wheat, etc. Wind mills were common in many countries, especially in Holland. They are still functioning and are a great attraction for tourists. Wood replaced wind as a source of energy, as it was available in abundance throughout the world, and also because it could be used anywhere unlike wind that was available only where it was swift and constant. Wood was burnt, and the heat was used to turn water into steam that became a very useful form of energy. This source of energy was used for a very long time in engines, steamers, machines, etc. till coal was discovered as a source of energy. Coal substituted wood for providing energy. It had an advantage over wood as it was higher and occupied less space for storage, and also gave more heat. Known as Black Gold, it was used in ships, mills, locomotives and used to generate electricity in thermal power stations. The work which has been going on regarding the minds of men suggests that one fifth of a second is about a limit for most of us in the matter of the useful division of time in our minds. But one fifth of a second. Short as it may seem, is a very long time indeed when it is considered in relation to a piece of time measuring only a thousandth millionth of a second. It is those same heavy going minds of men that have made the machines which are so quick, and it is men who have to tell the machines what to do. Without men to help them the machines can do nothing and are quite worthless. All the many and wonderful manufacture things in the world today come from the minds of the men. They do not make themselves; and it is very strange indeed to that men can manufacture machines which then do in work and carry out certain action better than himself. Man is a thinking being, and he has always directing much of his thought towards making things which would save him from hard labour.',
    
    'Dowry practice in India is a curse that has spread its poisonous tentacles to all corners of the country. It has not spared any caste or community. It is a shame that it is so prevalent in a society that has such a rich traditional culture. Dowry system has been in India since the ancient days. Girls and boys were married while they were hardly in their teens. The parents sent their daughter to her new home with lots of gifts and basic necessities that would sustain her and her husband till such time as the husband was old enough to start earning. This age-old tradition continues today, but now it is greed - that of the grooms folks - which has made it a social evil. In this modern age, where girls are given equal opportunities for higher education and better jobs, parents are wary of giving away their daughters in marriage to someone who is lesser qualified than them. On the other hand, if the boy has a high social standing and status in Society, and has a very lucrative job, then there is increasing demands made by his parents in the form of dowry. Many families cannot afford to meet these demands, and find their daughters left high and dry on the shelf. Late marriages, deaths and suicide, and bride-burning are a few commonplace occurrences, especially in rural areas of Northern India. India is one of the developing nations in the Worlds. Through rich in resources, considerable percentage of population live below the poverty line. Why are our people so poor ? Why are thousands of people starving and homeless ? Why is there poverty in the midst of plenty ? Why are we not progressing, as other countries are ? One of the important reasons for this is corruption. Corruption is responsible for this tragic state of affairs in our country. Everyone wants to become rich and lead a luxurious life as quickly as possible. In the mad rush for riches, qualities like honesty, sincerity and efficiency are sacrificed. Unfortunately, Indians, as a nation, are not concerned about the good of society. We fail to realize that if society benefits, we too will benefit. Hence, instead of complaining against and objecting to malpractices, we prefer the easy way out. We bribe people and grease their palms to get our work done knowing fully well that this is wrong to do so.',
    
    'Fashion means to make things in life in such a way as are subject to change in form and style according to the prevailing traditions. Fashions may be in dress, ornaments, hair style, customs, in food, drink, in amusements or in manners. Fashions change like wind which makes it difficult for man to keep pace with them. Fashion is found both among men and women. There is much craze for fashions among boys and girls. They watch TV programmes, see films and copy their style of talking, dress and walking style. They love dresses of the latest cuts and designs. They run after the new show and eye-catching dresses. Girls move freely in new fashions like butterflies. Boys too copy the film actors in their actions, stumes, hair style and even in waking. They keep long hair like girls. On the other hand, girls like boycut hairs and look boyish. Boys and Girls have made it a fashion to talk about cricket matches and films. It is the fashion for them to drive two matches at the high speed. They have also made it fashion to talk to their parents in English style instead of respecting them like Indians. They have made it fashion to run down their elders. There is no harm in changing fashions but excess of everything is bad. The craze for fashion must not go too far, should be in a limit. Secondary Market is a market where securities are traded. It is a place which provides liquidity to the securities issued in the Primary Market. The secondary market is represented by the stock exchange which provides an organised market place for investors to buy and sell securities. In other words, trading of securities subsequent to its primary offering takes place in secondary market. The secondary market induce investors to continuously rearrange their investments if they wish so. The initial buyer in the Primary Market may re-offer his securities to any interested buyer at mutually acceptable price. The stock exchange provides a market place where such mutually acceptable price may be determined. This active role of Secondary Market promoters growth of the Primary Market and encourages capital formation because investors in the primary market are assured of continuous and ready market for their investment. They can liquidate their securities in the stock exchange at any time.',
    
    'There is a time and place for everything. You must know the true value of time; snatch, seize and enjoy every moment of it. No idleness, no laziness, no procrastination. Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today. If work is done in time, it saves a lot of labour later on. For example, you notice that the button on your shirt is hanging loose. It would be better to sew it on tightly before you lose the button altogether. This applies to studies also. If you keep studying daily and not putting it off to a later date, examination time would not be one of tension and worry. Otherwise your mind will not be able to cope up with all the last minute cramming and learning. Everything will seem to be new and Creek to you then. Do not procrastinate and defer discussions to a later time. Do it now. The present is the time for action. If you have to send a reply to a letter, why postpone doing it when a later date would not have the same impact that an immediate response has ? Making excuses later on may not be the solution to patch up hurt feelings. As far as friendship is concerned, the right act at the opportune time binds friendships. If you need to apologies to someone, do it at once so that no ill feelings linger. Where health is concerned, never neglect medication. Dhira was a shoeshine boy. He lost his father when he was very young and now lived in a jhuggi with his mother and sister. Dhira was a hard working boy. After school, he would sit near a cinema hall and polish shoes for a living. One day it was very bot. Dhira sat under a tree counting his day’s earnings and humming a popular tune when he overhead a passerby. A thief has just escaped from the jewellery shop. Dhira stopped counting. He quickly put his money back in his pocket and asked the passerby. When ? Where ? Just on. He stole a gold necklace and managed to run away. They say he has a beard. So saying the passerby went on his way. Dhira was about to go towards the jewellery shop to find out more details when a customer accosted him. Boy, polish my shoes nicely. There’s no hurry. He said looking at his wristwatch. The customer was wearing a blue suit and a red tie. He looked like a rich man. Dhira was knowing.',
    
    'In an era where information flows freely, the role of journalists as guardians of truth and accountability is more crucial than ever. However, recent trends signal a troubling escalation in threats to press freedom and the safety of journalists worldwide. From physical attacks to legal harassment and online intimidation, journalists face an increasingly hostile environment that undermines their ability to report without fear or bias. 1)Rising Incidents of Violence and Intimidation The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reports a disturbing rise in attacks targeting journalists globally. From authoritarian regimes to democratic societies, journalists are facing threats to their safety in various forms. Physical assaults, kidnappings, and even assassinations have become all too common, particularly in regions plagued by conflict or political unrest. In countries like Mexico, where organized crime and corruption thrive, journalists risk their lives to expose wrongdoing. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Mexico ranks among the deadliest countries for journalists, with at least ten journalists killed in 2023 alone. Many more face threats, harassment, and attacks for their investigative reporting on sensitive issues. Similarly, in countries like Russia and Belarus, journalists critical of the government are routinely harassed, detained, and silenced. The recent arrest of Russian investigative journalist Ivan Golunov on fabricated drug charges sparked international outrage and renewed concerns about press freedom in the country. Despite Golunov release following public outcry, his case underscores the dangers faced by journalists who dare to challenge the status quo. 2) Online Threats and Digital Surveillance: In addition to physical violence, journalists also face significant threats in the digital realm. Online harassment, cyberattacks, and surveillance pose serious risks to journalist safety and freedom of expression. Social media platforms once heralded as tools for democratizing information, have become battlegrounds for disinformation campaigns and targeted attacks on journalists. According to the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), online harassment of journalists has reached epidemic proportions, with female journalists disproportionately targeted by abusive and threatening messages. The anonymity afforded by the internet emboldens attackers, who use tactics ranging from doxing to death threats to silence journalists and undermine their credibility. Moreover, governments and authoritarian regimes increasingly rely on sophisticated surveillance technologies to monitor and intimidate journalists. The use of spyware and hacking tools to infiltrate journalist devices poses grave risks to their safety and the confidentiality of their sources. Journalists operating in authoritarian regimes or conflict zones must navigate a digital minefield where their every move is scrutinized and their communications are vulnerable to interception. 3) Challenges to Press Freedom in Democracies Even in democracies with robust legal protections for press freedom, journalists are not immune to threats and harassment. The rise of populist movements and the erosion of trust in traditional media have furled hostility towards journalists and emboldened attacks on press freedom. In the United States, journalists face unprecedented challenges, including verbal attacks from political leaders, lawsuits aimed at silencing critical reporting, and physical assaults during protests and rallies. The Capitol insurrection of January 6, 2021, highlighted the dangers faced by journalists covering political unrest, as reporters were threatened and assaulted while documenting the chaos. 4) Call to Action: The growing threats to press freedom and journalist safety demand urgent attention and concerted action from governments, civil society, and the international community. Protecting journalists is not only a matter of upholding human rights and democracy but also essential for safeguarding the public right to access accurate and independent information. Efforts to address these challenges must include robust legal protections for journalists, accountability for perpetrators of violence and harassment, and support for independent media organizations. Journalists must be able to work freely and without fear of reprisal, whether they are reporting from conflict zones, exposing corruption, or holding those in power accountable. As threats to press freedom continue to evolve and proliferate, it is incumbent upon all stakeholders to defend the vital role of journalism in promoting transparency, accountability, and democracy. The stakes are high, and the time to act is now. 360 Global Efforts to Address Plastic Waste Pollution Gain Momentum with New Initiatives Plastic waste pollution has become a pressing environmental issue, with devastating impacts on ecosystems, marine life, and human health. However, amidst growing awareness and concern, global efforts to tackle this crisis are gaining momentum through innovative initiatives and collaborative actions. In recent years, the proliferation of single-use plastics has contributed significantly to the accumulation of plastic waste in landfills, oceans, and other natural habitats. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), approximately 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans every year, posing a serious threat to marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), businesses, and individuals are coming together to address plastic pollution through a variety of initiatives and strategies. One notable development is the increasing adoption of plastic bags and restrictions by governments around the world. Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Kenya have implemented regulations aimed at reducing the consumption of single-use plastics, including bans on plastic bags, straws, and other disposable items. These measures are designed to encourage the use of sustainable alternatives and reduce the production of plastic waste. In addition to regulatory approaches, there is a growing emphasis on waste management and recycling initiatives. Many countries are investing in infrastructure and technologies to improve recycling rates and reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills or the environment. Advanced recycling technologies, such as chemical recycling and pyrolysis, are being developed to convert plastic waste into valuable resources, such as fuel or new plastic products. Furthermore, public awareness campaigns and education programs play a crucial role in changing attitudes and behaviour towards plastic consumption and disposal. NGOs and environmental groups are leading efforts to raise awareness about the impacts of plastic pollution and promote sustainable alternatives. These campaigns aim to empower individuals to make informed choices and take action to reduce their plastic footprint. At the corporate level, many businesses are committing to sustainability goals and implementing measures to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics. Major companies across various industries are phasing out plastic packaging, introducing recyclable or compostable alternatives, and implementing strategies to improve the circularity of their products. Corporate initiatives such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation New Plastics Economy Global Commitment bring together businesses, governments, and NGOs to accelerate the transition to a circular economy for plastics. International cooperation and collaboration are also essential components of the global effort to address plastic pollution. Initiatives such as the UN Environment Assembly resolution on marine litter and microplastics and the G7 Ocean Plastics Charter bring together governments from around the world to coordinate action and share best practices for reducing plastic waste. Multilateral agreements, such as the Basel Convention amendments on plastic waste, aim to regulate the transboundary movement of plastic waste and prevent its illegal disposal or dumping in developing countries. Despite these efforts, challenges remain in addressing plastic waste pollution comprehensively. The scale of the problem requires sustained commitment and cooperation at all levels, from local communities to international organizations. Additionally, addressing plastic pollution requires a multifaceted approach that considers the entire lifecycle of plastic products, from production to disposal. In conclusion, the global momentum to address plastic waste pollution is growing, driven by a recognition of the urgent need for action and the potential for innovative solutions. With continued collaboration and collective effort, there is hope for a future where plastic pollution is effectively managed, and the health of the planet is safeguarded for generations to come',

    'In a country like India, where the population is very high and most of the people are poor, the bus is the cheapest form of transportation for long distances. Unfortunately, there are not enough buses to transport the masses from one destination to another. Hence, the buses are always overcrowded. In a big city where distances are great, buses are normally overcrowded. You find children using the bus to travel to school and colleges, men and women going to offices or shopping, patients going to hospitals, and so on. They are all jostling for a foothold in the bus. You find long queues at bus-stands, but when the bus arrives, everyone is rushing to get in, and the queue disappears. I had harrowing experience the other day. It was hot summer day in the morning. I was waiting at the bus-stop to board the bus that would transport me to the spot where I was attending an interview for a job. I gave myself enough time to reach the place well in time to attend the interview, and some to spare. After a wait of ten minutes I saw the bus approaching. I checked to see that I had the exact change to pay for my fare, and clutched by handbag tightly to my chest. The bus stopped right in front of me with three others ahead of me. I waited for them to get in first as we were in a queue. True success is measured by the feeling of knowing we have done a job well and have achieved our objective. Success is not measured by our position in life but by the obstacles we overcame to get there. Success in life is not determined by how we are doing compared with others, but by how we are doing compared with what we are capable of doing. Successful people compete against themselves. They better their own record and keep improving constantly. Success is not measured by how high we go up in life, but rather by how many times we bounce back when we fall down. It is this bounce back ability that determine success. Most people give up just when they are about to achieve success. They quit on the one yard line. They give up at the last minute of the game. One foot from a winning touchdown. Successful people do not do great things, they only do small things in a great way. Success and happiness go hand in hand. Success is getting what you want and happiness is wanting what you get.',
    
    'Walking is the safest and most convenient activity for weight control, ailment-free, healthy and all round physical fitness. But walking also gives one a lot of pleasure and satisfaction. Walking is about success, growth, determination and deduction. Did you know that walking uses large portions of muscle groups in your legs and arms in a steady, rhythmic pattern ? No wonder it is recommended for not just fitness but for total health too. It is the cornerstone of a total approach to personal fitness. Walking is one exercise that offers multiple advantages at a minimum cost and with least effort. Walking increases the flow of oxygen to all tissues and cells. It increases the high density lipoproteins which protects the heart and blood vessels from fatty deposits. It protects and strengthens the heart muscles whereby it can pump more blood with fewer beats. Walking increases the ability of the body to handle stress successfully, making you less prone to blood pressure and heart disease. It decreases the sugar fats, known as triglycerides, thus preventing their being deposited on the lining of the arteries. Walking also increases the efficient functioning of exercising muscles and blood circulation, so that muscles and blood can process oxygen more easily which has utmost importance. I was the last child of a small-town government servant, in a family of five brothers. My earliest memory of my father is as that of a district employment officer in Koraput, Orissa. It was and remains as back of beyond as you can imagine. There was no electricity; no primary school nearby and water did not flow out of a tap. As a result, I did not go to school until the age of eight; I was home-schooled. My father used to get transferred every year. The family belongings fit into the back of a jeep, so the family moved from place to place; without any trouble, my mother would set up an establishment and get us going. Raised by a widow who had come as a refugee from the then East Bengal, she was a matriculate when she married my father. My parents set the foundation of my life and the value system which makes me what I am today and largely defines what success means to me. As district employment officer, my father was given a jeep by the government.',
    
    'Man was meant to listen more and talk less. That is why as the great British statesman Benjamin Disraeli said Nature has endowed man with two ears and one mouth. If man was meant to talk more and listen less, he would have two mouths and only one ear. Imagine how we would have looked, how strange with two mouths on the two sides and one ear at the centre. And mind you, the ears are like funnels, open all the time. There is no door with which you can close them. Whereas if you have to speak even one single word, that word must pass through two walls-two fences. There is firstly the fence of these two rows of teeth. There is secondly the fence of the two lips. Before a word can be spoken, it has to pass, it has to pierce through these two walls, through these two fences. Therefore we must think at least twice before we utter a word. A very wise man once remarked that of the unspoken word you are a master, of the spoken word, you are a slave. Once you have spoken a word you cannot get it back, do what you will. Therefore you must be very careful about the words that you speak. Once the word has left your lips, you will not be able to get it back. What are unspoken words? They are things you want to say, but remain unsaid, as thoughts in your mind. Once you have put the thoughts into words, once the words have left your lips, you cannot change them or control them. A young man went to his spiritual teacher and said, I have spoken very harsh and unkind words to my friend, and he is deeply hurt. I am afraid I have lost my friendship with him. How can I make amends? The wise teacher gave him a fresh sheet of blank paper and a pen; he said to the young man, write down on this paper all the harsh things you said to him. The young man did as he was told, and showed the paper to the teacher. Now tear up this sheet of paper into as many small bits as you can, the wise teacher said. Soon, the single sheet was torn into a hundred tiny bits of paper. Throw the bits out of this window, the teacher told him. That was easily done! It was a windy day and the tiny bits were scattered far and wide even as the young man watched. Now, go out into the street and collect as many bits of the paper as you can, the teacher ordered him.',
    
    'The moon is shrinking and this may complicate future efforts to build a lunar base, scientists have said. A study estimates that the circumference of Earth only natural satellite has decreased by about 45m over the past few hundred million years. That may not sound like a huge amount for a heavenly body with a girth of nearly 11,000 km, but researchers believe that the shrinkage causes potentially severe moonquakes around the lunar South Pole precisely the spot where NASA hopes to land a crew in the coming years. Its diminished outline is a result of the moon iron core cooling and contracting over time. In much the same way as a grape wrinkles as it shrinks to become a raisin, the lunar surface is becoming more and more creased. This leads to so called thrust faults unstable areas where movement can lead to landslide triggering moonquakes that can last for hours. A study published in the Planetary Science Journal warns that this kind of activity could hamper Nasa Artemis 3 mission and any subsequent effort to establish a permanent research base. Planned for 2026 at present, Artemis 3 is supposed to mark humanity first return to the lunar surface since Apollo 17 touched down there in 1972. The southern pole is widely seen as the most promising site for a lunar colony. The Shackleton crater rim which is 4 km high, lies in perpetual sunlight which could provide power. Meanwhile, the bottom, which is always in shadow, may prove to be a good source of water in the form of ice. The new study includes computer simulations which suggest that slopes in the region may be especially vulnerable to landslides from seismic movement. Shallow moonquakes capable of producing strong ground shaking in the South Polar Region are possible, said Thomas Watters, a senior scientist emeritus at the National Air and Space Museum Canter for Earth and Planetary Studies. The danger of moon shrinkage leading to new instability should be considered when planning the location and stability of permanent outposts on the moon, he said. Professor Nicholas Schemer of the University of Maryland, a co-author of the study, said moonquakes could harm human settlements. You can think of the moon surface as being dry, grounded gravel and dust. Over billions of years, the surface has been hit by asteroids and comets, he said. As a result, the reworked surface material can be micron-sized to boulder-sized, but it is all very loosely consolidated. Loose sediments make it very possible for landslides to occur. As we get closer to the crewed Artemis mission launch date, it is important to keep our astronauts as safe as possible. This work is helping us prepare for what awaits us on the moon whether that engineering structure that can better withstand lunar seismic activity or protecting people from really dangerous zones.',
    
    'Both the tales have been used to make sense of the rains, the lightning and thunder. Both tales draw on the importance of water. It is probable that the ancient communities must have thought it necessary to worship a god of rains to ensure good harvests, abundance of drinking water and the resulting wellbeing of the people. Although the stories originate in the material world, they simultaneously fabricate a fantastic, imaginary world. They popularized the beliefs that several supernatural forces control the happenings of the world, reward or punish humanity for its various deeds. Rites and rituals were devised in order to please or appease these forces. As humans went on to observe the world, they realized that things do not randomly occur. They are related to one another. They often have a fixed sequence. For example in our type of climatic conditions; summer, monsoon and winter always arrive in the same order; water extinguishes fire but evaporates when heated. Thus they sensed that there is an order in the world and how of existence of things is governed by certain laws. In the human world it is humans who lay out the laws. Philosophers assumed that there must be someone who lays out the laws, the system of the natural world too. Perhaps the universe has been created by someone. The power it took to create the universe must be tremendous, rather infinite. These postulations gradually led us to the idea of God. Ideas concerning human beings possible, fitting relationship to God laid the foundation of religious thinking. Intellect was equally engaged along with imagination in this discourse. Normally religious thinking put a lot of emphasis on faith. One was asked to have faith in the otherworldly, supernatural power and in persons who were said to possess knowledge of the nature of that power. All that humans sensed or understood about the world found expression in manifold ways. They also perceived beauty in worldly objects and events apart from their properties, co-relations. The beauty fascinated them and inspired them to create beauty in response. From this emerged music, dance, painting and several other art practices. Art offers us the opportunity to indulge in life without being occupied with utility or profitability. It delights both the creator and the appreciator. Creativity is essential for art. Intellect is one of the faculties involved in the three aforementioned answers to questions arising out of man curiosity about the world. But the answers provided by Philosophy and Science are entirely based on human intellect. That does not mean imagination is thrown out of the window here. Many thinkers used their imagination to find answers in the times when observation and experimentation were severely limited. But here imagination was regulated by intellect. Only the ideas that stood the test of Reason retained themselves in philosophical thinking. One realized that events taking place in this world are not caused by otherworldly forces but by other events in this world itself.',
    
    'Surgery dates back to as early as 600 BC. Sushruta Samhita is one of the oldest works in the world dealing with surgery. It indicates that Sushruta was probably the first surgeon to perform surgical operations (plastic surgery). Later, some ancient surgeons performed tooth extraction and bloodletting. Major surgery could not develop for centuries because of lack of knowledge and technology. The doctors had to cut open the part of the body that was not healthy, remove it or set right that part. This would involve a lot of pain to the patient. General anaesthetics like ether or chloroform developed only from mid nineteenth century making painless surgical operations possible and successful. Modern techniques are used nowadays for anaesthesia. General anaesthesia benumbs the whole body, and it is used for surgery of any region of the body. For local anaesthesia, local anaesthetics are injected into the surgical spot or an area near nerves. Over the years now, revolutionary steps have been taken in different types of complicated surgery and these have made such operations successful. Let us start with Cardiac surgery. Today, if you need to have a heart surgery, you can choose from many fine doctors. However, before 1893 this type of surgery was unknown. Doctors did not have modern medical tools and procedures, essential for heart surgery. In those days heart patients were treated with sedatives and they usually did not survive. Then in 1893 Daniel Hale Williams, a young African American surgeon attempted a new medical technique in order to save a patients life. A patient, James Cornish, was suffering from a very serious knife wound. The knife had cut an artery less than an inch from his heart and punctured the pericardium (the sack around the heart). Dr Williams with six staff doctors, performed a complicated and daring operation. Dr Williams became the first surgeon to save his patient by successfully repairing the human heart. Bloodlettings draining out blood anaesthetics substances gases that make one feel no pain revolutionary causing a total dramatic change benumbs makes numb so that one does not feel any pain why did doctors begin to use anaesthesia?

Now many more advanced techniques are used to in this speciality, to deal with heart complications. Open heart surgery, which can help to repair heart defects, heart valves or even replace them, is also performed successfully. With proper measures, patients can recover from cardiac surgery faster than they did before.',

Due to some incident event childhood understood percepts of good and had for example parents, teachers gives applause and dislikes to which type of behaviour. Vocabulary in early childhood stage increases. Early childhood shows keen desire to learn meaning of new words and he tries to use them in his conversation for example. His original name was Davidas Debuji Maharaj who was born in Shedgaon village in Anjangaon Surji Taluka in Amravati District of Maharashtra to a Dhobi Family. A public teacher, he travelled from one place to another wearing his food pan upturned on his head and carrying his trademark broom. When he entered on village, he would instantly start cleaning the gutters and roads of the village. He also told the citizens of the village that their congratulations would have to wait until his work was done. Villagers gave him money. Babaji used that for progress of physical as well as thinking of society. From the obtained money, Maharaj built educational institutions, dharmashalas, hospitals and animal shelters. He conducted his discourses in the form of Kirtans in which he would emphasize values like service to humanity and compassion. During his Kirtans, he would educate people against blind faiths and rituals. He would use Dohas by Kabir in his discourses.',

There are men who are always reading. It does not matter where they find themselves or with when they are in company; they reach for the nearest thing with words in it and read it. They do not seem to read for pleasure or for knowledge but merely in order to read. They read advertisements of things they will never buy, and they even read time-table for trains they will never use. They read because it is less trouble to read than it is to speak. There are others who are not quite so careless about what they read and who do indeed read for pleasure, but they limit themselves to one kind of book and probably to a daily picture newspaper. If they are young girl’s they perhaps read only paper booked stories; if they are young men they perhaps read only stories of law-breakers. There are others, happily, who are wiser and who value more highly the great art of reading. Writing and reading must be considered the meet wonderful arts of mankind. When men learned to speak they showed themselves to be on a different plane from all other living things. Man is a beautiful creation of Nature. Dhira was a shoeshine boy. He lost his father when he was very young and now lived in a jhuggi with his mother and sister. Dhira was a hard working boy. After school, he would sit near a cinema hall and polish shoes for a living. One day it was very bot. Dhira sat under a tree counting his days earnings and humming a popular tune when he overhead a passerby. A thief has just escaped from the jewellery shop. Dhira stopped counting. He quickly put his money back in his pocket and asked the passerby. When ? Where ? Just on. He stole a gold necklace and managed to run away. They say he has a beard. So saying the passerby went on his way. Dhira was about to go towards the jewellery shop to find out more details when a customer accosted him. Boy, polish my shoes nicely. There’s no hurry. He said looking at his wristwatch. The customer was wearing a blue suit and a red tie. He looked like a rich man. Dhira was knowing.',
    
    'Farmers in India, in ancient times, were illiterate and were cheated out of their land, and exploited, suffering injustice. Unscrupulous landlords deprived them of their rights, moneylenders and middlemen got their thumb impressions on false documents of possession. With the spread of adult education, bonded labour, economic slavery, superstitious beliefs are on the wane. The problem with adult education though is that these adults have to earn their bread too. They can be taught only during their spare time near their houses. Nongovernment organisations can achieve this. Being illiterate they need to be educated about family planning too, as they usually have large families in the false belief that the more children they have the more income they will have with all their children earning. As the adults form forty per cent of the population, most of them living in villages, they are uneducated, hence, all the more need for adult education. In cities the uneducated constitute the slum dwellers, pavement hawkers and coolies at railway platforms. These are mostly engaged in manual work. So what kind of education do they need ? Not anything technical like history, science or economics. The simple 3Rules would be enough to get them going. They should be given knowledge about their country. A business organization cannot function without Capital. A joint stock company which is modern form of business organization, cannot start, carry on and expand its activities unless it can raise capital. A company needs capital to purchase land, construct building, buy plant and machinery, raw materials, employ people, market its products, pay transport and warehousing charges etc. Thus, like any business organization a company requires capital for various purposes. A company is in need of capital on different occasions. At company promotion stage it requires capital for bringing a body corporate into existence. Once it comes into reality it begins to run its business. At this stage it needs capital to carry on its every day business. At the later stage when it plans for expansion it also searches for more and more capital. So right from its commencement till its future growth, a company needs capital. In case of a small scale company its capital needs may be limited',
    
    'Student unrest is one of problems of the day. The problem, however, cannot be analysed properly unless we view it in the larger context of general unrest and discontentment in the country. As the things are, there is growing dissatisfaction everywhere. Prices are soaring and the burden of taxation is growing heavier. Corruption is ramphant everywhere. Academic institutions are no exception to it. These have polluted the students mind and created unrest in their hearts. Growing frustration is the root cause of students unrest. An average has nothing but frustration is store for him, especially in the matter of employment. He does not see any scope for a secure future for him. He joins one or the other course of study without any definite aim of his life. So he is frustrated. Political exploitation is another cause for student unrest. The vested interests in all political parties try to use the force of students for their personal ends. They patronise the student leaders in times of their union elections and ultimately use them for their personal needs through their agents and pollute academic atmosphere. They often instigate the students to indulge in anti-social and subversive activities. The uncertainty of future caused by international conflicts, aimless wars and mounting unemployment. Life is not just party and pleasure; it is also pain and despair, Unthinkable things happen. Sometimes everything turns upside down. Bad things happen to good people. Some things are beyond control. Such as physical disability and birth defects. We cannot choose our parents or the circumstances of our birth. If the ball bounced the wrong way for you, will you cry or take the ball and run ? That is a choice you have to make. You can see there are hundreds of boats sailing in all different directions in a lake. Even though the wind is blowing in one direction, the sailboats are going the different directions. It depends on the way the sail is set. And that is determined by the sailor. The same is true of our lives. We cannot choose the direction of the wind, but we can choose how we set our sail. Health, happiness and success depends upon the fighting spirit of each person. The big thing is that what we do about what happens to us. We can choose our attitude.',
    
    'The rate of population growth is larger in India as compared with other countries. Hence population is the basic reason behind financial, social, political and environmental problems in India.

    'A country which has the craze for self rule and in which all the communities consider itself as one is called a nation. Economic independence, culture, language and territorial integration are the ties of a nation. There is a feeling of oneness, unity and commonness in it. India is a country where National Integration is heard most. There has been political disunity, and rise and fall of various empires. Different languages are spoken here. People have different food habits. Different religious are propagated here. But Indian culture and customs has united the Indians and promoted a feeling of oneness and common citizenship. National Integration is a psychological process. It means a well knit society in which all are loyal to their country. It means that every Indian irrespective of caste, creed, language or religion belongs to India and is proud of his country. National Integration is very important for the all-round development of the country. In fact, its existence depends on it. There are different climates in India. Food habits are different, crops are different and there is a difference in faiths and beliefs. They wear different dresses. Even the Indian customs and conventions are cast and varied. The people pursue different sects and religions. There is difference in lands. The pattern of energy consumption in rural areas is important in any understanding of rural energy developments. With this end in view, let us examine the type of energy usage that takes place in the rural areas. Human Society acts on nature to produce either food or goods which are then consumed. Unlike animals, human beings not only acquire but also transform natural produce. Any such transformation requires energy as a necessary input. Energy and production always go hand in hand. Higher the level of production, higher generally is the level of energy utilisation. In this context, electricity, oil and coal are the common commercial energy sources which are being used in rural areas. Rural electrification was set as an important social goal in the India planning process. It was felt that the impact of electrification should not be considered in terms of narrow economic cost benefits but looked upon as an investment in terms of modernisation for the rural areas.',
    
    'Though there has been significant achievement in Energy conservation in organised sectors like us, no improvements have come from unorganised sector viz., single operator. In the national perspective, transport planning process, in which transport is linked with other sector economy, and the choice and capacities of each mode of transport should be decided after giving due consideration to requirements of various sectors, costs, energy efficiency and other factors. Government of India has clearly emphasised energy conservation as the most important objective in National Transport Policy. Road Transport is a vital sector of Nation economy, and it claims a good share of the energy consumed. Out of villages are yet to be provided with all-weather motorised routes. There will be minimum 10 per cent growth in energy consumption in the road transport conservation in Road Transport Section. Crores of rupees were spent in building roads to maintain them in good conditions. These are characteristic clouds which are indicators of thunderstorm. These look like huge mountains. These are dense and dark in colour. There is thunder accompanied by lightening. They bring rain with storm and may sometime bring hailstones. But such a type of rain does not last long. The largest of these clouds bring rainfall accompanied with lightning. The top portion of these clouds has an anvil like shape. The clouds have a positive charge at the upper and negative charge at the lower end. The land below them always has negative charge. Due to difference in the charges, electric chargers are formed and lighting occur lighting up the sky for a moment. The air around the lighting rises up because of the heat and this leads to a large thundering sound. As compared to other clouds, the rain drops of these clouds are larger because they move up and down a lot of times and accumulate more and more water. Drops become larger and larger and are unable to float in the clouds because of their weight. They fall in the form of rain. Sometimes, the air in the clouds is very cold. As a result, these drops freeze and fall in the form of hail. We call them hailstones. Raindrops coming towards the earth are stopped in the clouds itself because of strong vertical winds which change into hail.',
    
    'Development and growth are terms which are commonly used to convey the same meaning but there is a great difference. The term growth is used in purely physical sense. It generally refers to an increase in size, length, height and weight. Changes in quantitative aspects come in the domain of growth. It is one of the parts of developmental process. Changes which takes place in a particular aspect of the body and behaviour of and organism are described by growth. It does not continue throughout the life. The changes produced in growth are the subject to measurement. They may be quantified. Development involves a series of progressive, orderly and meaningful changes leading to the goals of maturity. It implies overall changes in shapes, form or structure resulting in improved working or functioning. It indicates the change in the quality or character rather than in quantitative aspect. Development is a continuous process. It goes from womb to tomb. It does not end with the attainment of maturity. Development, as said earlier implies improvement in functioning and behaviour and hence brings qualitative changes which are difficult to be measured directly. They are assessed through keen observation in behavioural situation. Thus the term Growth and Development implies ones behaviour and personality make up. True success is measured by the feeling of knowing we have done a job well and have achieved our objective. Success is not measured by our position in life but by the obstacles we overcame to get there. Success in life is not determined by how we are doing compared with others, but by how we are doing compared with what we are capable of doing. Successful people compete against themselves. They better their own record and keep improving constantly. Success is not measured by how high we go up in life, but rather by how many times we bounce back when we fall down. It is this bounce back ability that determine success. Most people give up just when they are about to achieve success. They quit on the one yard line. They give up at the last minute of the game. One foot from a winning touchdown. Successful people do not do great things, they only do small things in a great way. Success and happiness go hand in hand. Success is getting what you want and happiness is wanting what you get.',

    'Once a certain king had an idea. If he always knew the right time to begin everything, if he knew who the right people to listen to were and who to avoid the most important thing to do, he would never fail in anything that he would undertake and above all, if he always knew what was the most undertake. Since he was convinced that he was right in thinking this way, he had a proclamation made in his kingdom. He would give a great reward to anyone who would teach him what the right time was for every action, which the most necessary people were, and how he might know the most important thing to do. Many learned people came to the court but they all gave different answers. In reply to the first question, some said that to know the right time for every action, one must draw up in advance a table of days, months and years, and must live strictly according to it. Others declared that it was impossible to decide beforehand the right time for every action; but that, not letting oneself be absorbed in idle pastimes, one should always attend to all that was going on, and then do that which was most essential. Yet others said that it was impossible for one man to decide correctly the right time for every action and that the king should, instead, have a council of wise people, who would help him to fix the proper time for everything. Equally varied were the answers to the second question. Some said, the people, the king most needed, were his councillors; others the priests; others the doctors while some said the warriors were the most necessary. To the third question about what was the most important occupation, some replied that the most important thing in the world was science. Others said it was skill in warfare; and others, again, that it was religious worship. The king was convinced by none of these answers and gave the reward to none. He decided, instead to go to a hermit who was widely renowned for his wisdom. The hermit lived in a small hut in a forest which he never left. He spoke only to common folk. So the king put on simple clothes and approaching the hermit cell, dismounted his horse and left his bodyguard behind. When the king arrived, the hermit was digging the ground in front of his hut. He greeted the king but went on digging. The hermit was frail and weak, and each time he struck the ground with the spade and turned over a little earth, he breathed heavily.',
    
    'The co-operative movement in India was started by establishment of Credit Co-operative Society. These societies were established with an objective to provide short and middle term loans to the farmers in rural area. In olden days loan were given by the moneylenders to the farmers in rural areas. But these moneylenders were exploiting farmers. Hence to save the farmers from the exploitation by moneylenders and to fulfil the financial needs of the poor farmers. In 1904, British government encourage the establishment of Credit Co-operative Society. Credit co-operative societies were established to provide strong alternative for moneylenders. Accordingly, in 1904 Credit Co-operative Societies Act was passed by British government. According to the provision of this Act credit co-operative societies were established in each and every village. Commercial bank, Public sector bank, Urban co-operative bank provides loan to business and industrialist. Co-operative bank provides loan in rural area to marginal farmers, land labours, craftsmen, artisan, small businessmen and people of weaker section of society. The structure of Co-operative banking is three-tier, at state level State Co-operative bank, at district level District Central Co-operative bank and at rural (village) level Primary Credit Co-operative society are established. The Credit Co-operative societies are established with an objective to protect the people from the cheating and exploitation of landlords and private moneylenders. The societies which are formed for development of agricultural sector on co-operative principles to provide loan at reasonable interest rate are known as Credit co-operative society. The working area of Credit co-operative society is the village in which Credit co-operative society is established. The farmers, artisan, craftsmen, small businessmen of that village are the members of this society. This society encourages the habit of saving among members. This society provides loan to the farmer members at low rate of interest. These co-operative societies are working for economic development of agricultural sector, farmers and are trying to improve their standard of living. These co-operative societies provide loan as per the primary needs of the members, these co-operative societies directly deal with the members (directly provides loan to the members) hence they are known as Primary Credit Co-operative Societies. Credit co-operative societies works in rural and urban areas. The society established to increase agricultural productivity, to improve the standard of living of farmers, in addition to provide short and medium-term loan, to supply agricultural requirement, various services and supply of essential commodities etc. is known as Credit Co-operative Society The membership of Credit co-operative society is open for all. Credit Co-operative societies are voluntary association. Farmers, land labours, workers and economically weaker people in the rural area come together and voluntarily form Credit co-operative society. There is no compulsion for membership on any person.',
    
    'In a historic achievement, NASAs Perseverance rover has successfully landed on Mars, marking a major milestone in humanity exploration of the Red Planet. The culmination of years of planning, engineering, and anticipation, the landing represents a triumph of scientific innovation and perseverance. The Perseverance rover, a state-of-the-art robotic explorer, embarked on its journey to Mars atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on July 30, 2020, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. After a journey of nearly seven months covering over 300 million miles (470 million kilometres), the rover entered the Martian atmosphere on February 18, 2021, in a complex and meticulously choreographed landing sequence known as the Seven Minutes of Terror. The landing process, fraught with challenges and uncertainties, required precise execution to ensure the rovers safe arrival on the Martian surface. As the spacecraft descended through the thin Martian atmosphere, it deployed a parachute to slow its descent before firing retrorockets to further decelerate. In the final phase, the rover was gently lowered to the surface by a sky crane, which then detached and flew away to avoid any potential collision with the rover. The tense moments during the landing were met with jubilation and relief as mission control at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, received confirmation of the successful touchdown. Cheers erupted among the team members, who had devoted years of their lives to designing, building, and preparing the rover for its mission on Mars. The primary objective of the Perseverance mission is to search for signs of ancient microbial life and collect samples of Martian rock and soil for future return to Earth. Equipped with advanced scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and a drill capable of collecting core samples, the rover will explore Jezioro Crater, a 28-mile-wide (45-kilometer-wide) basin believed to have once contained a lake billions of years ago. One of the key instruments aboard Perseverance is the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE), which aims to demonstrate the production of oxygen from the Martian atmosphere. This technology could pave the way for future human exploration of Mars by enabling astronauts to produce oxygen for breathing and use as rocket propellant. In addition to its scientific objectives, Perseverance is also carrying out several innovative technologies and experiments, including the Ingenuity helicopter, a small robotic helicopter designed to demonstrate powered flight in the thin Martian atmosphere. If successful, Ingenuity could open up new possibilities for aerial exploration of Mars and other planetary bodies. The successful landing of Perseverance comes on the heels of previous NASA missions to Mars, including the Curiosity rover, which has been exploring the Martian surface since 2012. Each mission builds upon the knowledge and experience gained from previous endeavours, advancing our understanding of the Red Planet and preparing the groundwork for future human missions. The international scientific community has hailed the achievement as a testament to human ingenuity and collaboration, with researchers around the world eagerly anticipating the wealth of data and insights that Perseverance will provide. From unravelling the mysteries of Mars geological history to unlocking the potential for future human exploration, the mission holds promise for expanding our understanding of the cosmos and our place within it. As Perseverance begins its mission on Mars, it carries with it the hopes and aspirations of countless scientists, engineers, and space enthusiasts who have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge and exploration. With its arrival on the Martian surface, the rover embarks on a new chapter in humanity quest to unlock the secrets of the cosmos and push the boundaries of what is possible.',
    
    'The most powerful mother known to human beings is the rocket. It is the only one that can propel space craft to other planets and put satellites into orbit around the earth. Yet it is one of the easiest to understand, for even the giant space shuttle works on the same principles as the rockets you see at firework displays. The toy firework was probably invented in China over 700 years ago. It has changed little since then. It is simply a tube filled with gunpowder packed very tightly. When the flame from the rockets burning fuse reaches the gunpowder, there is a violent chemical reaction. Different substances in the gunpowder combine and turn into hot gases at high pressure. They try to expand, and if the tube were closed at both ends, the gases would tear it apart. But there is an opening at the lower end of the tube, and the gases rush out, forming a bright glowing trail, called the exhaust. It is the force generated by chemical reaction that pushes out the exhaust gases. But wherever a force is exerted on something, there is a reaction an equally strong force in the opposite direction. For example, when you fire a refile, you feel it kick against your shoulder. The gun is pushed back by the reaction to the force that drives the bullet forward. If you were standing on roller skates while carrying a heavy bag, and you were unwise enough to throw the bag away from you, you would find yourself rolling away in the opposite direction. The reaction to your throwing the bag would have given you an equal and opposite push. In the same way, the explosion of the gunpowder in the rocket tube not only pushes out the exhaust gases. As we have seen, national income of India is low but what is even more distressing is that the National Income is unevenly distributed. Inequalities of income are a common feature of all economics. But the degree of inequality of incomes to be found in India is especially falling. A very small section of a society possesses and enjoys a relatively larger share of national income and wealth compared to others in the nation it shows inequality in the distribution of income and wealth in the country. This inequality in the personal distribution is important to study the problem of poverty in India. It also indicates how different sections of the society share the national income and wealth and how distribution pattern of income has changed over the period. It seems that the large number of people claimed minimum income and small number of people received maximum income. Many studies revealed that there existed a high degree of inequality in the distribution of income, assets and concentration of economic power in few hands. Inequalities of income and wealth lead to some various serious economic, social and political consequences. Hence the government has to undertake remedial measures to eradicate poverty and to reduce inequalities in income and wealth. The Government of India has adopted economic planning since 1951 to achieve certain aims and objectives and thereby to achieve rapid economic development. Basically, there are two important objectives of planning in India namely improving standard of living of the masses and establishment of socialistic pattern of society. In 1975, the problem of poverty was heavily focussed',
    
    'The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. This proverbial statement emphasises the role of a mother in the building or a nation. This role is indisputable indeed. A mother is the best nurse, guide and guardian that a child can have. It is for her to make a saint of him of a dacoit. It is for her to cultivate in him undaunted courage of object cowardice. The formative years of a mans life are spent in the lap of his mother. Whatever stamp of mould his impressionable day gets from his mother becomes his permanent mark, Shivaji, the great Indian warrior, learnt the fundamental lessons of warfare from his mother, who also inspired him with the legends of the great heroes of the old. Almost all the great men of the world will gratefully acknowledge the influence of their mother in their early development, although, women having a self-effacing nature, this influence may not be recorded anywhere.

    'Too many people seem to be content to spend their time in just carrying out the purposes of others. They work for nothing but the pay, they think more about the pay than the purpose. Give them the pay, and somebody else can have the purpose, for all they care. In this way millions of people live unhappy lives just I because they do not have a purpose you can and should have a purpose of your own. At the same time, you can serve the purpose of another and serve it even better. You can still have the pay and yet be working out your own purpose. Remember that all good purposes tend in the same direction and go hand in hand. Decide now that you will have a purpose, then your life will be the richer. Your eyes will soon, begin reading all the copy you are typing by phrases or world groups. The words combine into a short chain. Every time your eyes see that chain of words, you set up a chain of acts that enable you to reproduce the word group. So, there should be a purpose in our life. I had seen her at a road crossing for years. Wherever I had stopped at the red light she came bearing one child in her arms another following her, tugging at her dirty and torn-at-places dhoti. She always had a bundle of newspapers in her arm and would tap at the closed windows of air-conditioned cars and ask the occupants to buy one. If she found an open window, she would drop a copy and wait a while, then, without uttering a word go to another open window and repeat the trick. Most often it worked and some called her and gave her a coin or two, much higher than the price of the paper, and some, in their hurry as the traffic lights would give the go signal, would throw the coins or notes towards her and speed away. But there were some who would close their windows at her approach and other sit quietly or turn their faces the other way. She seemed a very satisfied women and even if people rebuked her on occasions, she would ignore it and continue to sell her papers without a second thought to the scolding. Often, I saw this woman sitting on the grass or dust of the road eating a meal and feeding her son with home-made bread. Sometimes with lentil or otherwise just plain chapatis. I used to wonder why this woman, who must be earning quite well, was so indifferent towards her food. One day it so happened that my car stopped all of a sudden and I let it run along the side to avoid getting in the way of traffic. I opened the hood of the car to see if it was something very minor which I could deal with. I tinkered with the battery terminals, checked the pipe going to the carburettor, meddled with the cut-outs start',
    
    'In a small business concern goods received may well be unpacked by the owner and invoice, or packing note, checked at the same time. He may also check the goods against the order to ensure that they are as ordered both as to type and quantity. If the business is large enough for this work to be entrusted to others, it is the responsibility of the owner to control it by making checks from time to time. No question of fraud is being considered here, control in this case being to ensure that goods received are those required. The system of checking will change with the number of staff available. The work to be done is to check goods against the order goods against invoice, pricing of Invoice and then checking them into store. Some method will have to be followed to ensure that these checks are carried out with all goods arriving. If it is possible to entrust the work, so that a different person is in charge of each section that will help the owner of the business but this is not always possible. The Planning Commission has reportedly set up a twelve-member national committee on tourism. The task entrusted to it is to tell the commission whether tourism ought to be encouraged and if so, how to go about it. Had this been Nineteen Fifty-Six instead of Nineteen Eighty-Six, one might have felt enthused by the idea of such a committee. Thirty years ago, tourism was scarcely recognised as an industry worth promoting. There is also no longer any mystery about how to promote tourism, and there are examples galore of country which have achieved singular success in attracting the foreign holiday maker. It is, therefore, difficult to see just what the national committee is going to say that has not been said already time and again. Basically, tourism grew when it became possible for the mass of people in the west to take cheap holidays in foreign countries. Three factors made this possible, transportation, cheap, easy and safe, and the necessary permission to international hotel chains and airlines to operate freely. The national committee will no doubt talk of incentives and infrastructure. It will reiterate the well-known that India should open up the tourism sector, allowing more cheap fares, encourage the growing flow of middle-income tourists in search of inexpensive holidays and develop destinations that are infrequently visited. It will spend time, no doubt in discussing industry concessions and initiatives, and review the procedures and red tape make for cumbersome travel and sightseeing in this country. But in the end, it will probably recognise that its best efforts will come up against its preview',
    
    'This spring, artists are engaging in seemingly spontaneous conversations with one another across performances about identity, climate, and how to contextualize canonical composers for contemporary audiences. American works about cruelly thwarted dreams hit the stage. The choir Master Voices gives a concert of Ricky Ian Gordon the Grapes of Wrath, an opera that shines with goodness, at Carnegie Hall (April 17). Huang Ruo and David Henry Hwang opera An American Soldier, about the tragic death of the Chinese American private Danny Chen, shortly after he joined the Army, in 2011, has its New York première, at pac nyc (select dates May 12-19). The Micro Quartet brief survey of twentieth and twenty-first-century American art music, at the Church of the Intercession, in Harlem (May 4), adopts a tenderly elegiac tone, with famed string pieces by George Walker and Samuel Barber. Other ensembles fill in that history with missing voices. At Town Hall, Kronos Quartet and Ghost Train Orchestra delve into the extensive catalogue of Moondog (April 16), a blind composer of simple, catchy songs, who was known as the Viking of Sixth Avenue for the horned helmet and cloak that he wore on the streets of New York in the fifties and sixties. For the centenary of the Black composer Julia Perry birth, the Experiential Orchestra mounts a four-day festival, which closes at Alice Tully Hall with Perry aching Prelude for Strings and her piquant Violin Concerto (March 16). John Adams El Nino, a Nativity oratorio that humanizes Mary experience of motherhood, has its Metropolitan Opera premiere (select dates April 23- May 17). Dan Schlosberg and Amanda Quaid The Extinctions, in Heartbeat Opera first world premiere, also contends with a birth a woman wrestles with the moral dilemma of bringing a child into a world that appears to be falling apart as a result of global warming (Baruch Performing Arts Centre; select dates April 2-14). The director Peter Sellers, whose work is both visionary and humane, likewise concerns himself with climate collapse in Shall We Gather at the River, an original show that weaves together spirituals and Bach cantatas, at the Park Avenue Amory (May 21); the cast includes the smooth-voiced countertenor Reginald Mobley. Bach crisscrosses with the modern era in two programs one by the pianist Simone Dinner stein, who pairs his lilting symphonies with music by Keith Jarrett and Philip Lasser, at Miller Theatre (April 25), and the other by the cellist Alisa Weilerstein, who couches Zoltan Kodaly twisting Sonata for Solo Cello among Bach cello suites, at the 92nd Street, New York.',
    
    'The run-up to the general election this year is a propitious moment to interrogate the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition self-presentation of its rule to the electorate, in whose name it governs. As the ruling coalition seeks a third consecutive mandate at the Centre, one can trace a tangible shift in the coalition campaign pitch to voters. At the surface, one finds a perceptible repositioning in the campaign mainline narrative economic progress and softer cultural rejuvenation has morphed into welfare guarantees and blunter Hindu majoritarianism. At a deeper level, the defining characteristic of the sought mandate has turned away from promises of socio-economic transformation and moved closer towards a referendum on a hegemonic political order. The latter shift can be gauged from the disproportionate political capital expended towards demonstrating the ineptitude or venality of the opposition parties. The government appears on less sure ground on its billboard Modi ki guarantee theme a motley of stated government achievements (identified in a personalistic manner with the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi) across social, economic and cultural fronts. The rationale for the government apparent hesitancy in clearly foregrounding a pro-incumbency campaign similar to the NDA India Shining campaign in 2000 is not particularly hard to fathom. While the term guarantee signifies an expectation of certainty, the claims encoded within the guarantees appear to carry, on the whole, a much more limited popular credibility. Guarantees versus survey To illustrate the point, let us juxtapose the claimed guarantees being proffered in the Prime Minister name, with the corresponding set of survey evidence (taken from last month biannual India Today Mood of the Nation (MOTN) survey). The guarantee of A Promising Ecosystem for the Amrit Peedhi portrays a rapid pace of job creation reducing the unemployment rate from 5.8% in 2018-19 to 3.2% in 2022-23. In contrast, the voter survey exhibits a marked dissatisfaction on job creation, with only about a third of respondents crediting success to the government on this front. The welfare guarantee also appears to be on a shaky foundation as 62% express difficulty in managing daily expenses. What about the empowering annadata (farmers) guarantee or the middle class emerges a winner guarantees? The survey shows a plurality (45%) blaming government policy for widening the gap between rich and poor. What about the Indian Economy A Story that Inspires guarantee? A quarter believes their household income will improve in future, while three-quarters believe it will either remain stagnant or worsen. In fact, more respondents expect a reduction in future income (30%) than those who expect an improvement (25%). The most damning indictment is expressed on the question probing which sections are seen to have benefited most from government policies 52% say big businesses, compared to 9% for farmers, 8% for salaried classes and 6% for daily wage labourers.',
    
    'We travel, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next, to find ourselves. We travel to open our hearts and eyes and learn more about the world than our newspapers will accommodate. We travel to bring what little we can, in our ignorance and knowledge, to those parts of the globe whose riches are differently dispersed. And we travel, in essence, to become young fools again to slow time down and get taken in, and fall in love once more. The beauty of this whole process was best described, perhaps, before people even took to frequent flying, by George Santayana in his lapidary essay, The Philosophy of Travel. We need sometimes, the Harvard philosopher wrote, to escape into open solitudes, into aimlessness, into the moral holiday of running some pure hazard, in order to sharpen the edge of life, to taste hardship, and to be compelled to work desperately for a moment at no matter what. Few of us ever forget the connection between travel and travail, Travel in that sense guides us toward a better balance of wisdom and compassion of seeing the world clearly, and yet feeling it truly. For seeing without feeling can obviously be uncaring; while feeling without seeing can be blind. Yet for me the first great joy of travelling is simply the luxury of leaving all my beliefs and certainties at home, and seeing everything I thought I knew in a different light, and from a crooked angle. Though it is fashionable nowadays to draw a distinction between the tourist and the traveller, perhaps the real distinction lies between those who leave their assumptions at home, and those who do not. Among those who do not, a tourist is just someone who complains, Nothing here is the way it is at home, while a traveller is one who grumbles, Everything here is the same as it is in Cairo or Cuzco or Kathmandu. It is all very much the same. But for the rest of us, the sovereign freedom of travelling comes from the fact that it whirls you around and turns you upside down, and stands everything you took for granted on its head. If a diploma can famously be a passport (to a journey through hard realism), a passport can be a diploma (for a crash course in cultural relativism). And the first lesson we learn on the road, whether we like it or not, is how provisional and provincial are the things we imagine to be universal. We travel, then, in part just to shake up our complacencies by seeing all the moral and political urgencies, the life and death dilemmas, that we seldom have to face at home. And we travel to fill in the gaps left by tomorrow headlines. When you drive down the streets of Port-au-Prince, for example, where there is almost no paving your notions of the Internet and a one world order grow usefully revised. Travel is the best way we have of rescuing the humanity of places, and saving them from abstraction and ideology.',
    
    'There is a sense of awe in the atmosphere as the nipping winds of winter pierce through ones body sending a chill down ones spine. The cold grows stifling and an overpowering numbness seizes ones entire existence. Trees shed their leaves and put on a bleak look; Fields look desolate. The sky wears mournful grey. But the Laws of Nature decree that winter cannot rule eternally. It is soon followed by spring and refreshing spring winds begin to blow. Their caressing touch rejuvenates life and there are sudden thrilling pulsations in the air. Streams gently roll, soft showering in ones ears. Flowers bloom and the air gets laden with soothing fragrance. The cyclic pattern of Nature is reflected in life as well. Suffering and misfortune may assail one for a while and envelop ones entire existence with drooping despair. But they must inevitably disappear and give way to hope and happiness as the fog disappears before the sun. If one can save ones vision from winter, he can perceive a silver lining. There is good deal of talk about ceiling and one naturally has to agree with it because one wants to remove disparities. But one has always to remember that the primary function of growing society is to produce more wealth otherwise it will not grow. There are many wrong statements made and much misunderstanding concerning the such and effects of introducing computers for commercial practice. It is wrongly supposed by many that computers are the answer to all difficulties, that their use will correct bad business practices and be the fairly God mother, converting losses into profits. It is believed that all that is necessary is to feed facts and figures into a computer and you will get a magic answer to any problem. This is not so, feed rubbish into a computer and you will get rubbish. After all, computers are only electronic machines relying on human skills to construct them, operate them, feed them with information from which an answer is required. The commercial use of these electronic magicians is for data processing, the organizing of data detailed information for which certain definite uses are planned, for example many large business organizations compile their payrolls by this means. Information is organized and fed into the machine and the result is a complete and detailed pay roll. The organization of the material is operated programming. The programme is the most important factor in computer work and those who undertake this work are specialists. Information is fed into the machine by means of punch cards, paper tape, or magnetic tape effectively over the page. People can thus have great help using computers',
    
    'A recent study conducted by leading scientists from around the world has unveiled a concerning trend: a significant decline in global bee populations. The findings of this study, published in the prestigious journal Nature, highlight the urgent need for action to address the threats facing bees, which play a crucial role in ecosystem health and food security. The study, a comprehensive analysis of bee populations spanning several continents, involved researchers collecting and analysing data from various sources, including field studies, academic literature, and government reports. The results paint a grim picture: bee populations have declined by an alarming 37% over the past decade, with certain regions experiencing even steeper declines. Several factors have been identified as contributing to the decline in bee populations. Habitat loss due to urbanization and agricultural expansion ranks among the top concerns. Pesticide use, particularly neonicotinoids, has also been implicated in bee declines, as these chemicals can interfere with bee navigational abilities and overall health. Climate change, disease, and parasites further exacerbate the challenges facing bee populations. Bees are essential pollinators, playing a critical role in the reproduction of flowering plants, including many crops that humans rely on for food. The decline in bee populations threatens not only the biodiversity of ecosystems but also agricultural productivity. A significant reduction in bee populations could lead to declines in crop yields, affecting food security and economic stability worldwide. The decline in bee populations poses a direct threat to food security, as approximately 75% of the world crops depend, at least in part, on pollination by bees and other pollinators. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, and oilseeds are among the crops most reliant on bee pollination. A decline in bee populations could result in reduced yields, increased food prices, and disruptions to global food supply chains. The findings of this study underscore the urgent need for action to address the threats facing bee populations. Conservation efforts must focus on preserving and restoring bee habitats, including the creation of pollinator-friendly landscapes in both urban and rural areas. Additionally, stricter regulations on pesticide use, particularly neonicotinoids, are necessary to protect bee health. Addressing the decline in bee populations requires collaboration on a global scale. Governments, scientists, farmers, and other stakeholders must work together to implement policies and practices that promote bee conservation and sustainable agriculture. International agreements, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, provide a framework for collective action to safeguard pollinators and biodiversity. Investment in research and innovation is essential for developing solutions to mitigate the threats facing bee populations. Scientists are exploring alternative pest management strategies, breeding more resilient bee species, and studying the impacts of climate change on bee habitats. Public and private funding for bee research and conservation initiatives is crucial for advancing these efforts. The alarming decline in global bee populations highlighted by this study is a wake-up call for humanity. The loss of bees poses a significant threat to ecosystems, agricultural productivity, and food security. Urgent action is needed to address the complex challenges facing bee populations, including habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. By working together and prioritizing bee conservation efforts, we can protect these invaluable pollinators and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.',
    
    'Adversity can prove highly beneficial to mankind. It can bring one courage, maturity and understanding. Having once been through adverse circumstances, one is certain to face the rest of ones life with greater courage and confidence. Adversity also develops a mans capacity to sympathies with the suffering humanity. He who has never suffered can never understand what suffering is. The value of tears can be appreciated only by a man who has shed them himself. Adversity purifies a man. Gold, when it is melted in fire, gets purified. It is a proverbial saying that God sends us into deep water not to drawn us but to wash us clean. Adversity also provides a man with an opportunity to test the sincerity of those who claim to be sincere to him. Prosperity gains friends, adversity tries them. Besides, adversity, by contrast, enhances the pleasure of prosperity. Adversity can be really useful to man provided he has a positive attitude towards life. Thus, sweet are the fruits of adversity. Ever since man first walked on the earth, he has suffered from disease. People have tried to fight disease in many ways, by taking special herbs, by avoiding certain foods and even the practicing magic. Yet all the time that they were doing these things, they did not know how disease was caused. Today, we know that it is caused by very small living things which we cell germs. These germs harm us when they enter into our bodies. They do this in different ways. For example, the germ which causes malaria in us lives in the blood. When a mosquito bites someone who has malaria, it sucks in some of those germs. Later when it bites someone who is healthy, it passes the germs on to him. Flies too, carry the germs from an infected person to a healthy man. Fortunately, we have good natural defines against many germs. Our bodies are made up of millions of very small cells just as a building is made up of many tones or bricks. Some of these cells move about, eat away germs to stop them from harming us. We also make special substance on our bodies which attack germs for us. Some of these substances are always present in our bodies. For example, our tears contain some to protect our eyes and or saliva contains some to protect our mouths. Other substances are made inside our bodies when certain kinds of germ attack us. These substances are called and bodies and each protect us against only one kind of germ. As it happens, we cannot produce anti-bodies against every kind of germs. Another way of protecting ourselves against sickness it to stop the germs from ever reaching us. For this we have to hygienic in the way we live',
    
    'Do not worry, be happy. Take out all the worries from your mind. So always be happy, Worry makes you tense and affects the nerves. Whereas laughing and being happy will keep the whole body fit. Life is like a bicycle, when it is not moving it falls. A smile creates happiness. If costs nothing but gives a lot. If enriches those who give. We must live and enjoy every minute, every second of life. Where there are sorrows in our life, there is also happiness. A life of sacrifice is the art and is full of true joy. Until we taste the sorrow, we will not be able to know the meaning of true happiness. Life is a bundle of events which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Have courage for the great sorrows of life and patience for a small one. Sleep in peace, God is awake. Face all the problems of your life with a smiling face because sorrows and happiness are the two main things of life. So, always be cheerful and be bold, because without these things there is no meaning of life. Books are out true friends. They are our constant companions who stand by us through thick and thin. We happy in their company, they never desert us. We never lonely if we like to read. They give us courage to face lifes struggles, fill our hearts with hope, and cheer us when we are in despair. Light fiction and mystery novels help us to pass our leisure time in a pleasant manner. At the same time, they improve our language and sharpen our intellect and logical thinking. Books written by great personalities like Nehru, and biographies and autobiographies of great men, inspire us to strive for greatness. Many of us have been influenced by books written by great philosophers like Swami Vivekananda and Sri Arbindo, and as a result our lives have changed for the better. Travel books take us to countries we may, perhaps never be able to actually visit in our lives. They reveal to us the lifestyles and habits of people we have never seen. Historical books tell us about past tales and of great wars fought in the past. All of us like to read stories of the Rani of Jhansi and Shivaji. We read great epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata and learn a lot about our culture. A good book is a friend, philosopher and guide to all those who read it. Books are the best medium to pass on our knowledge and ideas to the future generations. Books are the windows to the world. A glimpse into books gives us a glimpse of the world. Just as it is necessary to choose our friends, it is also necessary to choose books carefully. The choice depends on our tastes and interest. Like our friends, our books should help us in our studies',
    
    'In the bustling heart of Indias Silicon Valley, Bengaluru, a quiet crisis is unfolding, casting a shadow over the city vibrant tech landscape, and challenging the resilience of its diverse businesses. The deepening water shortage paints a stark picture, revealing a city on the brink of an environmental reckoning. As we navigate the nuances of this unfolding situation, it becomes evident that beyond the immediate concerns lie broader implications that demand attention. The acute water scarcity is not merely an inconvenience. It is a wake-up call for all stakeholders, from global corporations to local eateries and residents. The textile industry, a vital economic player in Bengaluru, is feeling the pinch, with garment factories grappling to maintain regular production. This is not just about a momentary disruption. It signals a potential economic downturn that could ripple through various sectors if sustainable practices are not urgently adopted. The challenges extend beyond the industrial landscape. Restaurants, the beating heart of any city social life, are forced to adapt, with water bills doubling and establishments contemplating disposable plates to alleviate the burden of water intensive cleaning processes. This shift reflects not only the financial strain on businesses but also underscores the interconnectedness of our daily activities with the availability of a precious resource. Global corporations, often seen as trendsetters in environmental consciousness, are not immune to the crisis. They are implementing water saving measures, acknowledging the gravity of the situation. Yet, these efforts, while commendable, raise larger questions about the long-term viability of our current consumption patterns. Are these temporary fixes enough or do they merely serve as Band-Aids on a wound that requires more profound healing? The strikes by water tanker providers add another layer of complexity to the issue. While price regulations are being enforced, the underlying problem remains unaddressed. The city dependence on tankers points to a systemic vulnerability that urgently needs systemic solutions. The allocation of funds by the government is a step in the right direction, but the scepticism among industry leaders highlights the need for transparent and effective governance to ensure that these resources are deployed judiciously. In the face of adversity, some individuals are making unconventional choices, preferring to work from the office due to water scarcity in their residential areas. This adaptive behaviour underscores the profound impact the crisis is having on the daily lives of Bengaluru residents and the lengths to which people are willing to go to cope with the situation. As we dissect the layers of Bengaluru water crisis, it is evident that this is not just a regional issue. It is a microcosm of the larger global water challenge. It compels us to question our consumption patterns, the sustainability of our industries, and the efficacy of our governance structures. Bengaluru struggle should serve as a catalyst for a broader conversation on water conservation, pushing us to revaluate our relationship with this finite resource and seek inspiring, innovative and sustainable solutions for a water-secure future.',
    
    'The eighteenth century has gifted English literature two entirely new forms which are without any traces in the ancient classical heritage. One of those was The Periodical Essay and the other was NOVEL. Both of these forms, especially Novel, caught the spirit of the eighteenth century as the age of intellectual, sentimental and realistic plane and tried to instruct the readers, which would help them to a more purposeful and virtuous life. Since the time of its origin, novel has been gaining popularity and growing gradually. Today, it is recognized as the most dominant literary genre. A Novel is a relatively long narrative fiction which describes intimate human experiences normally in a prose form. The present English word novel is derived from the Italian novella, meaning new. A Novel narrates a story embellishing it with more details of time, place, nature, people and their minds, their gestures and activities. It presents the picture of the society of that period. Novel makes life easier to understand than in drama and poetry. In modern era, novel has adopted literary prose. Novel as a literary genre has a history of about two thousand years. Among the early precursors of novel a collection of tales known as Greek Romances dating from the second to sixth century may top the list. These imaginative and delightful stories of ideal love and marvellous adventures profoundly affected the creative writing for the next thousand years. Though novel in the modern era usually makes use of a literary prose the earlier threads of the genre can be found in Virgil Ecologues or Malory Morte De Arthur or Geoffrey Chaucer the Canterbury Tales. Lady Murasaki Shikibu Tale of Genji (1010) has been described as the world first novel. The European novel is often said to begin with Don Quixote by Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes which was published in two parts between 1605 and 1615. In the 18th century, the appearance of newspaper and magazines attracted a large number of readers from the middle class. These new readers had little interest in romances and tragedies, which were appreciated by the upper class. Thus, need for a new type of literature arose that would express the new ideas of the 18th century. The 18th century new literature was characterized by the spirit of realism and denial of romantic features like enthusiasm, passion and imagination. The foreground for the novel was prepared by all these factors. After 1740, Novel originated as the literary form in England. Increase in trade and commerce, along with the Industrial Revolution, gave rise to the middle class. A class of people had emerged to occupy an elite status. The realistic picture of everyday life and problems of common people depicted in the novels appealed to the newly educated class and was regarded by them as respectable reading material.',
    
    'As the world continues its battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to vaccinate populations across the globe have reached a critical stage. While vaccination campaigns have been underway in many developed nations, reaching remote communities in developing countries has presented significant challenges. However, recent initiatives have shown promising progress in ensuring that even the most marginalized populations have access to life-saving vaccines. In remote regions of developing countries, accessing healthcare services can be a daunting task due to limited infrastructure, challenging terrain, and logistical hurdles. Despite these obstacles, health authorities and humanitarian organizations have been working tirelessly to bring COVID-19 vaccines to these underserved communities. Partnerships between governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and international agencies have been instrumental in facilitating the vaccination drive in remote areas. These collaborations have enabled the mobilization of resources, including vaccines, medical supplies, and trained healthcare workers, to reach communities that are often overlooked. Recognizing the unique needs and circumstances of remote populations, vaccination campaigns have adopted tailored approaches to ensure maximum coverage. Mobile vaccination clinics, outreach programs, and door-to-door campaigns have been deployed to overcome barriers such as transportation limitations and vaccine hesitancy. The vaccination drive in remote communities has not been without its challenges. Limited access to reliable transportation and cold chain infrastructure has posed logistical challenges in maintaining the integrity of the vaccines. Additionally, misinformation and mistrust of vaccines have hindered efforts to achieve high vaccination rates in some communities. Despite these challenges, there have been notable success stories in reaching remote communities with COVID-19 vaccines. In regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, vaccination teams have braved rugged terrain, extreme weather conditions, and cultural barriers to deliver vaccines to isolated villages and nomadic populations. Community engagement has played a crucial role in the success of vaccination campaigns in remote areas. Local leaders, community health workers, and grassroots organizations have been instrumental in building trust, dispelling myths, and encouraging vaccine uptake within their communities. The impact of vaccinating remote populations in developing countries extends beyond the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. By reaching these communities, vaccination efforts contribute to reducing disparities in healthcare access and strengthening health system resilience against future pandemics. The successful vaccination drive reaching remote communities in developing countries represents a significant milestone in the global fight against COVID-19. While challenges remain, the collaborative efforts of governments, NGOs, and local communities have demonstrated the importance of equity and inclusivity in vaccine distribution. As vaccination campaigns continue, it is essential to sustain momentum and ensure that no community is left behind in the quest to end the pandemic.',
    
    'In the heart of the Himalayas lies a region that has been a crucible of contention for decades. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visit to Jammu and Kashmir sends ripples through the political landscape, echoing the seismic shifts triggered by the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. As he stood in Srinagar, Mr Modi proclaimed a transformed Kashmir, now seamlessly integrated into the fabric of India. The abrogation of Article 370, a move that stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special status, was a contentious decision, sparking heated debates on constitutional legality and its geopolitical ramifications. Mr Modi visit, the first in five years, underscores the government commitment to its core promise the integration of Kashmir into the Indian Union. However, the optics and motivations behind this visit warrant a closer examination. For many, especially those outside the region, the transformation of Kashmir might seem like a laudable achievement. Mr Modi, in his address, emphasised the newfound courage of the people to overcome challenges and touted the developmental strides made in the last five years. The launch of tourism and farm projects adds a forward-looking dimension, projecting Kashmir as a potential global success story. Yet, amid the applause, there lingers a complex tapestry of historical grievances, geopolitical tensions, and human rights concerns. The region, scarred by decades of militant violence, is also a flashpoint in the longstanding rivalry between India and Pakistan. The visit, strategically timed weeks before general elections, serves not only as a reaffirmation of the government commitment but also as a political signal to voters. The lockdown-like security measures during Mr Modi visit armed personnel, commandos on Dal Lake, and a ban on drone usage reflect the on-going fragility of the situation. Schools were shut, and exams postponed, showcasing the delicate balance between asserting control and managing potential unrest. Kashmiri politicians critical of the abrogation, like Ms Mehbooba Mufti, have framed the visit as a political manoeuvre to sway the BJP core constituency in the rest of the country in the upcoming elections. The promise of a new elected legislative assembly for Jammu and Kashmir, coupled with infrastructure projects, paints a vision of progress. However, the absence of elections and the Supreme Court directive to hold polls by September 30 injects an element of uncertainty. The political landscape in Kashmir remains a puzzle, with pieces yet to fall into place. As this story unfolds, it provokes essential questions about the nature of transformation and development. The answers may determine not only the fate of Kashmir but also the trajectory of India democratic experiment. In the global arena, where geopolitical tensions draw attention to this sensitive region, Mr Modi visit amplifies the complexities surrounding Kashmir. The story of Kashmir, as it continues to evolve, demands nuanced attention, transcending electoral calculus to navigate the delicate interplay of history, politics, and human rights.',
    
    'When faced with a loss, crisis or life - changing event, we may be suddenly thrust into an unfamiliar world, one that is frightening and challenging. The first step towards coping with a loss is to accept the circumstances we are in. Non-acceptance or denial destroys peace of mind and gives rise to anger, anxiety and frustration. It may also lead to a feeling of self-pity. In such a case, a person resigns himself to his fate and loses his self-confidence. He is not able to cope with the reality. But a person who accepts the ups and downs of life and prepares himself to take life as a challenge gets a new strength from within to fight and succeed. The thought that there is nothing permanent in life, that highs must follow lows and lows have inevitably to be succeeded by highs can also prove to be encouraging. It can give us strength to face unfavourable circumstances with perseverance and fortitude. The crown and glory of life in character. It is neither power nor pelf nor even physical prowess but character alone that can bring glory to a man. Power corrupts and breeds bitterness and resentment; wealth is merely a passing shadow, endowing upon men but shadowy glamour, mere physical prowess is the attribute of a beast or a giant, it is only one character - invincible moral courage, unimpeachable integrity, that can bring one personal satisfaction and high esteem among others. Character constitutes one essence, what on really is. Want of character implies meaningless existence. If Gandhiji could transform the hearts of millions of people all over the world and shake the foundations of mighty British Empire, it was by virtue of his character, his unflinching faith in the earnestness of his cause and his unconquerable will power. He has immortalised himself because he was man of character. Character cannot be developed in a day. It takes years of self-exploration. Every day many people need to buy, and others wish to sell their goods. Whenever and whenever these people meet there is a market, but it is not a market place in the usual sense. It may be round a stall, in a shop or in a ware house or factory. There are large and famous market under one roof, such as the stock exchange, and the various commodity markets, such as the cotton, wool and tea exchange. But markets need not be under one roof. A number of men connected by telephone, or even walking in and out of banks and offices to deal with each other can be a market.',
    
    'In our day to-day life we exchange our ideas, thoughts and other information with our friends, relatives and other people. Sometimes we directly talk to them and sometimes we also write letters to them. In letters we express our feelings in a few words, we may ask for any information or we may write about a complaint in connection with our problems. Similarly, businessmen also exchange ideas, information by writing letters. They communicate business information to customers, suppliers and others and at the same time receive a variety of letters from them. We communicate our feelings, thoughts etc. to our friends and relatives through letters that may be called personal correspondence. A Businessman also writes and receives letters in his day to-day transactions, which may be called business correspondence. Business correspondence or business letter is a written communication between two parties. Businessmen may write letters to supplier of goods; he may write letters to Banks for loans. Student unrest has become a common feature of education all over the world. The good old days of struck obedience and difference shown to teachers and lecturers are things of the past. This is a sorry state of affairs when the present generation of youth are relied upon to be the future leaders of a nation. A student is not an exclusive entity in himself. He lives in a society where he interacts constantly with his own kith and kin, his friends and others, like teachers, peons, neighbours, vendors and so on. He is influenced by them to a certain degree and imbibes both virtuous and negative aspects from them. In todays society, we see many students spending or wasting their time on strikes and agitation when they should be in class pursuing better interests. They are a misguided lot and a different attitude on the part of teachers and principals is partly responsible for such a state of affairs. Students are also politically motivated and are seen joining demonstrations, slogan shouting, taking our processions against the Government, damaging and looting public property. This is compound by their resorting to addiction of drugs, alcohol and smoking. Such types of behaviour indicate a disturbed and restless mind. Our educational system needs to be revamped. Students are compulsorily made to learn subjects that have no bearing on the course that they want to pursue, or to their practical life. This leads them to frustration. The home atmosphere is also a cause for unrest among students because they are neglected by their parents who have hardly any time for them due to social engagements.',
    
    'John Keats, one of the celebrated romantic poets, begins his poem Endymion with this off - quoted line: A thing of beauty is a joy for ever. And he goes on to assert that its loveliness keeps increasing with the passage of time and it never passes into nothingness. Keats concept of beauty is quite comprehensive. It includes, besides physical beauty, mental excellence and moral purity. If an object is to be a source of permanent joy, it must be beautiful in its entirety and not just physically attractive. Skin deep beauty decays fast. But beauty ingrained in the tissues of an object is a permanent quality. The very touch of this kind of beauty comforts ones heart and elevates one mentally and morally. If we are surrounded by real beauty of the kind conceived of by Keats, it moves away the pal of darkness from our spirits and enables us to shed our despondency and regain our happiness. Not only physical beauty but moral purity and mental excellence is also important. Discipline is the great binding force of a nation. It is the backbone of a nation. It is not something that is talent in person, something that has to be cultivated. It is a long process that starts from the family to society, from the society to the nation. It is necessary in a society and nation for the world to function smoothly and effectively. It is a valuable asset at all levels of society. Imagine a family or a school where indiscipline prevails. Children from such environments grow up being aggressive and ill mannered. Discipline involves people in doing their duty judiciously, diligently and sincerely. It is the essence of life, whose absence results in a nation be set with anarchy and restlessness. It is necessary in every walk of life and in every activity. If there is discipline in school, a child will learn to behave and follow the rules that are set by schools. It is a teachers task in school the parents role at home a managers need in a company to inculcate the importance and sense of discipline in the citizens. For most adults, discipline is a natural quality that comes naturally. They should set good examples for youngsters to emulate them. Children and teenagers are swayed by popular trends and styles which distract them from their path of higher progress. So, they have to disciplined to move on the right path. They therefore need guidance from elders, teachers and parents. Discipline is born of a sense of responsibility among people. That is why European nations, and some Asian countries like Japan and Singapore, where you see a lot of discipline among their people, are so prosperous and powerful.',
    
    'In recent years, tech giants have come under intense scrutiny over their handling of user data and privacy practices. From Facebook to Google to Amazon, these companies have faced allegations of mishandling sensitive information, selling user data to third parties, and failing to adequately protect user privacy. As concerns grow among consumers and lawmakers alike, regulatory scrutiny and calls for reform have reached a fever pitch. The issue of data privacy has become increasingly prominent as technology continues to permeate every aspect of modern life. From social media platforms to e-commerce websites to smart home devices, users are constantly generating vast amounts of data, much of which is collected and stored by tech companies for various purposes, including targeted advertising, product development, and algorithmic optimization. However, the extent to which these companies collect and use data has raised significant concerns about privacy infringement and the potential for misuse. In recent years, numerous high-profile data breaches and scandals have underscored the risks associated with centralized data storage and lax data security measures. One of the most notable examples of data privacy controversy involves Facebook and its handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In 2018, it was revealed that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly obtained and used personal data from millions of Facebook users for political advertising purposes without their consent. The incident sparked outrage and led to calls for greater oversight of tech companies data practices. Similarly, Google has faced criticism for its data collection practices, particularly regarding the vast amounts of personal information it gathers through its various services, including search, email, and maps. Concerns have been raised about the company use of this data for targeted advertising and the potential for abuse of user privacy. Amazon, too, has come under fire for its handling of user data, particularly about its smart home devices such as the Echo and Ring. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about the devices always-on listening capabilities and the potential for unauthorized access to sensitive conversations and personal information. In response to mounting pressure, tech giants have taken steps to improve their data privacy practices and enhance transparency. Many companies have updated their privacy policies, implemented new data security measures, and introduced tools to give users greater control over their personal information. However, critics argue that these measures are not enough and that more comprehensive regulatory action is needed to address systemic issues related to data privacy and protection. In recent years, governments around the world have begun to take action to regulate the tech industry and hold companies accountable for their data practices. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has imposed strict requirements on companies operating in the European Union, including tech giants, regarding the collection, storage, and processing of user data. The GDPR has set a new standard for data privacy regulation and has prompted similar efforts in other jurisdictions. In the United States, lawmakers have introduced various proposals for federal privacy legislation aimed at establishing comprehensive guidelines for data privacy and protection. However, progress has been slow, with partisan divisions and industry lobbying posing significant obstacles to legislative action. As the debate over data privacy continues to evolve, the role of tech giants in shaping the future of privacy rights and protections remains a topic of intense scrutiny and debate. While companies have made efforts to improve their practices, concerns persist about the adequacy of existing regulations and the need for stronger enforcement mechanisms to hold tech giants accountable for their actions. In conclusion, tech giants face increased scrutiny over their data privacy practices as concerns grow about the collection, use, and protection of user data. While companies have taken steps to address these concerns, more comprehensive regulatory action is needed to ensure adequate privacy protections for users in an increasingly digital world.',
    
    'In 2020, Paul Judge and Ryan Glover, both seasoned Black entrepreneurs, started work on a plan to help solve one of America most intractable social problems the yawning wealth gap between White households and Black and Latino families. After facing decades of discrimination by banks, Black and Latino customers need a safe, welcoming place to put their money, they argued, as they developed a plan for launching Greenwood, a banking platform rather than a traditional bank. Launched amid the racial justice protests that followed the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, Greenwood quickly drew support from prominent Black celebrities, including music producer Jermaine Dupri, and banking giants such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. Glover and Judge boasted that 700,000 potential customers had signed up for Greenwood waitlist before it even launched products. But in the three years since, and after a second round of funding that valued the company at $325 million, Greenwood has failed to meet some of its initial goals, according to a review of public statements and interviews with company leaders and former employees. Less than a quarter 4 about 150,000 4 of the people on the waiting list opened accounts, and Greenwood has been slow to launch promised financial products, including credit cards and business loans. Instead, the company has acquired a portfolio of companies outside of the world of finance, including a private club in Atlanta, and a website that bills itself as traditional Black banks really, have the ability to do what it is they claim that they want to do, which is better serve Black customers while turning a profit, because they are just too small. Greenwood has taken on a monumental task. About half of Black adults and one-third of Latinos are either unbanked or under banked, meaning they dont have a traditional checking or savings account and use alternative financial services like payday lenders or title shops for loans, according to the Federal Reserve. That is compared with 15 percent of White Americans. Without traditional bank accounts that often make it easier to secure loans, these Black and Latino customers fall further behind economically, increasing the country racial wealth gap, experts say. The median wealth, a household assets minus debts, of White families stands at $285,000, compared with $44,900 for Black families and $61,600 for Hispanic families, according to the Federal Reserve. Bridging that gap requires a financial company unlike any that has existed before, said Glover, pointing to Greenwood efforts to educate customers on personal finance. When Judge approached Glover with the idea to start Greenwood in early 2020, Glover, who was 49 at the time, was trying to figure out what he wanted to do with the rest of his career. He had founded Noontime Records, a label that produced more than a dozen Billboard No. 1 hits, in the early 2000s. In August 2017, he had sold Bounce TV; the first Black-owned television broadcast company, to E.W. Scripps in a $292 million deal. He had gone from working more than 120 hours a week to a life of leisure.',

    'The study of supply is as important as the study of demand. Supply is a fundamental economic concept that describes the total amount of a specific good or service that is available to a seller. The total amount of goods or services available for sale at any specified price is known as supply. Output is produced in the process of production. Total output can be defined as the sum total of the quantity of the commodity produced at a given period of time in the economy. Production leads to consumption. In the process of production inputs are converted into output or final goods. Stock is the total quantity of commodity available for sale with a seller at a particular point of time. It is the source of supply. It is potential supply. By increasing production, stock can be increased. Without stock, supply is not possible. Normally, stock exceeds supply and it is fixed and inelastic. In case of perishable goods such as milk, fish etc. stock may be equal to supply. On the other hand, for durable goods such as furniture, garments etc. stock can exceed the supply. Supply is a relative term. It is always expressed in relation to price, time and quantity. The word supply implies the various quantities of a commodity offered for sale by producers during a given period of time at a given price. It is related to time and price. Supply is a flow concept. It refers to the amount of a commodity that the firms produce and offer for sale in the market over a period of time, say a day, a week, a month or a year. According to Paul Samuelson, Supply refers to the relation between market prices and the amount of goods that producers are willing to supply. Supply refers to the quantity of a commodity that a seller is willing and able to offer for sale at a given price, during a certain period of time. For example, a farmer total output of rice is 4000 kg. This is the total stock. If the price is 40 per kg He offers 1000 kg. For sale. This is the actual supply. A supply schedule is a tabular representation of the functional relationship between price and quantity supplied of a particular commodity. Individual supply schedule refers to a tabular representation showing various quantities of a commodity that a producer is willing to 4 Supply Analysis 38 sell at various prices, during a given period of time. Price is an important factor influencing the supply of a commodity. More quantities are supplied at a higher price and less quantity are supplied at a lower price. Thus, there is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied.',
    
    'In a stark wake-up call to the world, a new report released by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has underscored the urgent need for immediate and decisive action to combat climate change. The report, compiled by hundreds of scientists from around the globe, warns that without significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the planet will face increasingly severe and irreversible impacts, ranging from extreme weather events to the loss of entire ecosystems. Titled Climate Change 2024: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, the report presents a comprehensive assessment of the current state of the climate and its projected future trajectory. Drawing on decades of research and observational data, the findings paint a grim picture of the consequences of continued inaction. One of the most alarming aspects of the report is its identification of the widespread and far-reaching impacts of climate change on both natural and human systems. Rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and sea-level rise are already exacerbating extreme weather events such as heatwaves, storms, and droughts, with devastating consequences for communities around the world. According to the report, vulnerable populations, including those in low-lying coastal areas, small island states, and arid regions, are particularly at risk. These communities often lack the resources and infrastructure needed to adapt to the rapidly changing climate, leaving them disproportionately exposed to its impacts. Furthermore, the report highlights the interconnectedness of climate change with other global challenges, such as food security, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss. Changes in temperature and precipitation are disrupting agricultural systems, reducing crop yields, and threatening the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on agriculture for their sustenance. The loss of biodiversity, driven in part by climate change, is also a major concern raised in the report. Ecosystems such as coral reefs, forests, and polar regions are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress, leading to declines in species abundance and diversity. These changes not only threaten the stability of ecosystems but also jeopardize essential ecosystem services upon which human societies rely, such as clean air, freshwater, and pollination. In light of these findings, the report emphasizes the need for immediate and ambitious action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. This will require rapid and far-reaching transformations across all sectors of society, including energy, transportation, agriculture, and industry. The report also stresses the importance of adaptation measures to build resilience to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. Investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, and sustainable land management practices can help communities prepare for and respond to the challenges ahead. In response to the report, world leaders and policymakers are facing renewed pressure to prioritize climate action on the global agenda. Calls for stronger commitments to emissions reductions, increased climate financing for developing countries, and enhanced international cooperation are growing louder in the face of the escalating climate crisis. The urgency of the situation cannot be overstated. With each passing day, the window of opportunity to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change narrows. The decisions we make now will determine the fate of future generations and the health of the planet for centuries to come. As the world grapples with the profound challenges posed by climate change, the findings of the IPCC report serve as a sobering reminder of the need for swift and decisive action. Only by working together, across borders and sectors, can we hope to address this existential threat and secure a sustainable future for all.',
    
    'According to correspondence theory of truth, the truth of a proposition depends on its relation with reality. In contrast, the coherence theory of truth propounds that the truth of a proposition is dependent on the relation it has with other propositions. The system of knowledge is constructed by putting together many true propositions. The knowledge of any particular subject is not just an aggregate or a group of true propositions. Knowledge is a system of those propositions. All these propositions are consistently related to each other. A proposition, the truth value of which is to be tested, is said to be true if it is consistent with other accepted truths in that particular field of knowledge. If there is a proposition which says that if a number X is multiplied by zero, the number you get is X, then this proposition is false. This is so because, it is not consistent with the accepted truth in mathematics that if you multiply any number by zero, the resulting number is always zero. If someone tells us that the birth year of my mother is 1995 and that of my father is 1993 and I am born in 1990, then, we will obviously conclude that the last statement is false. It is not consistent with the earlier two statements (which we assume to be true), as no one is born before the birth of his or her parents. These examples bring it to our notice that consistency or coherence is a significant criterion of truth. Some problems arise with respect to this criterion too. Even if a system of mutually coherent propositions is created, how can we be assured that it is true? Have you read stories of Harry Potter or seen movies based on them? Fictitious stories like these, whether they are fairy tales or science fictions, are internally coherent, yet not true. Why is this so? Because, these stories do not fit to reality or actuality. In empirical sciences along with consistency, correspondence to reality is also important. Without such correspondence, the propositions that claim to describe reality can never be true.',
    
    'In a landmark development for the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin, the world largest and most well-known digital currency, surged to a new record high amidst a wave of institutional adoption. The cryptocurrency price skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, surpassing previous milestones and igniting renewed enthusiasm among investors worldwide. The surge in Bitcoin price comes as institutional investors increasingly embrace digital assets as part of their investment portfolios. Over the past year, major financial institutions and corporations have been gradually warming up to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate store of value and a hedge against inflation in an uncertain economic environment. On [Feb, 2023], Bitcoin price reached an all-time high marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market. This surge was fuelled by a combination of factors, including institutional buying pressure, growing mainstream acceptance, and optimism surrounding Bitcoin long-term potential as a digital store of value. One of the driving forces behind the Bitcoin rally has been the increasing institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. High-profile investors, hedge funds, and corporations have been allocating significant capital to Bitcoin, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and a way to diversify their investment portfolios. Notably, institutional investors have been attracted to Bitcoins scarcity and its potential to serve as a digital alternative to traditional stores of value such as gold. With a finite supply capped at 21 million coins, Bitcoin scarcity has contributed to its appeal as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and inflationary pressures. In addition to institutional adoption, growing mainstream acceptance has also played a crucial role in the Bitcoin surge. Major financial services firms, payment processors, and online retailers have begun embracing Bitcoin as a form of payment, providing users with greater accessibility and utility for the digital currency. Moreover, regulatory clarity and institutional-grade infrastructure have improved significantly in recent years, providing investors with greater confidence and trust in the cryptocurrency market. Regulatory developments, such as the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in some jurisdictions, have further legitimized Bitcoin as an investable asset class. The surge in Bitcoin price has sparked renewed interest and enthusiasm among retail investors, who are eager to capitalize on the cryptocurrency upward momentum. Retail trading volumes have surged, with platforms reporting record-breaking levels of activity as investors flock to buy Bitcoin in hopes of capturing future gains. Despite its meteoric rise, Bitcoin price remains volatile, and investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before investing in cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin has generated substantial returns for early adopters and investors, it is not without risks, and its price can experience sharp fluctuations in a short period. Furthermore, sceptics and critics continue to raise concerns about Bitcoin long-term viability and its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. Regulatory scrutiny, environmental concerns related to Bitcoin mining, and technological challenges remain significant hurdles that the cryptocurrency must address as it continues to evolve. Looking ahead, the future of Bitcoin remains uncertain, with both bullish and bearish arguments being debated among investors and analysts. While some believe that Bitcoin price could continue to soar as institutional adoption grows and mainstream acceptance expands, others caution that a market correction could be imminent, leading to a sharp decline in Bitcoin price. In conclusion, Bitcoin surge to a new record high amidst growing institutional adoption represents a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market. Institutional investors, mainstream acceptance, and regulatory developments have all contributed to Bitcoin rise, sparking renewed enthusiasm among investors worldwide. However, investors should remain vigilant and aware of the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, as Bitcoin prices remain volatile and subject to market dynamics.',
    
    'The rise and development of Bhakti movement in medieval Maharashtra illustrates how political and social history of a geographical region in a given time influences the philosophical discourse. The Bhakti sampradaya reassured a society that was plagued by political instability and social inequality, deprived of education and dignity. It instilled a sense of self-worth in the peoples. The saints from Bhakti movement deliberated on themes such as God, religion, spirituality in colloquial tongues and opened the gates of Indian philosophical tradition to one and all. Furthermore, Bhakti philosophy severely scrutinized the inordinate prevalence of ritualism, and criticized harmful customs, superstitions. They asserted that people do not require middlemen (i.e. priests) in order to connect to God. The saints synthesized belief in God with immaculate moral conduct, attempting to elevate the social practices. The philosophy of these saints became a guiding light in day to day life rather than an abstract thought. In Maharashtra, the saint tradition that began with Jnaneshwara went on to flourish well into the 20th century. The saints expressed their philosophical views and ideas in popular literary performative genres such as Abhanga, Bharuda, Gavalana to make them accessible to the wider population. They created social awareness through Bhajana and Kirtana. Jnaneshwara proclaimed the world is my home, the interrelations between Historical conditions and Philosophy in the Indian context (He vishwachi majhe ghar). He presented Chidvilasvada. Saint Namadeva travelled to Punjab, wrote Abhanga in the local dialect and emphasized the solidarity between Bhakti traditions across the regions. Samartha Ramdasa and saint Tukarama eagerly proclaimed that true devotion and the love for all life-forms are inseparable. Saint Ekanatha used anecdotes from day to day life to preach virtue and spirituality. Gadage baba and Tukadoji maharaja created social awakening by presenting philosophical ideas through socially relevant, contemporary content. The philosophy that bears relevance to its times and circumstances is proved of great use in many walks of life. You must have studied the social, political and cultural changes that took place in 19th century India under the British rule. They caused a great intellectual stir. Foreign administrative system, social system, value system and ways of thinking posed challenges to Indian tradition. Our thinkers undertook an in-depth study of our traditions while confronting the challenges. They analyzed acceptable as well as unacceptable ideas, values from the foreign tradition and attempted to synthesize antiquity and modernity. The philosophization from this period once more engaged in critical examination of religion, since religion occupied a central place in Indian tradition. Thinkers attempted once again 20 Philosophy Std 11 to seek true religiosity and loosen the hold of ritualism, superstitions and baneful practices on social psyche. Lokamanya Tilak, Yo. Gopal Ganesha Agarakara championed rationalism. Mahatma Phule established Sarvajanika Satyadharma that overthrew cattiest code.',

    'A portioning blame for calamity after a natural disaster is almost impossible, but Indian cities have often tried to ease this decision, and Chennai on December 4 was no exception. Late on December 3, rains began to pummel Chennai as Cyclone Michaung, soon to intensify into a super-cyclonic storm, parked itself roughly 100 km east of the city. By the next morning, most areas had recorded more than 120 mm of rain, with a few recording more than 250 mm. The figures represent a breathtaking volume of water to be delivered in a single day and which Tamil Nadu Minister for Municipal Administration K.N. Nehru echoed when he said the city had not received as much rain in seven decades. But that is not the full story. The narratives built around disasters influence the responses to them, and proclamations that attribute a singularity to a natural calamity often feed an unfair line of reasoning in which nature shoulders all the blame. Just as the rain intensified over Chennai on December 4 mornings, the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited shut off power in the city as a precaution, presumably to prevent loose cables from electrocuting pedestrians in dirty water. That such a precaution was required at all speaks volumes about the state of the power infrastructure. There are no quick fixes or short cuts in addressing years of inadequate investment in maintenance and repair. Several trees were toppled, water stagnated on almost all roads, overhead cables flew loose, and storm water drains were choked with plastic trash. Many trains were cancelled, the airport had to be closed, and there were reports of people being stranded at many locations. Yet, that 2023 was not 2015 redox is to the city as well as to the storm credit the former because of the warnings and preparation, more resilient civilian infrastructure, and people memories of 2015 the latter because it dumped less water than the 2015 torrent did in a single day The ninth Mizoram Assembly election results, 2023, mark both a continuity and a change in Mizoram electoral politics. Like in the past, this election not only leveraged a multiparty electoral contest within the framework of what Balveer Arora in a different context calls the bimodal system but also ensured that the Mizo National Front (MNF) lost after a term in power. In other words, this system perpetuates a system of a revolving door wherein an alternate party has come to power in every one or two election cycle since 1987. The impressive win by the Zoram People Movement (ZPM), a regionalist party formed in 2017 and registered with the Election Commission of India barely four years ago it won 27 seats and an over 37% vote share is a spectacular improvement from its tally of eight seats and a 22% vote share in 2018. This marks a break from the past. An interesting break from the past Unlike in the past, where the binodal electoral contest was always between a national party and regionalist parties, this election pivoted around a contest between two rival regionalist parties, i.e., the ZPM and the MNF.',

    'In a concerted effort to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, governments around the world are ramping up their commitments to carbon neutrality. As a result, investments in renewable energy sources have surged to unprecedented levels, signaling a significant shift towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy landscape. The global push towards carbon neutrality gained momentum following the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015, which saw nations pledge to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Since then, countries have been stepping up their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner, renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. One of the driving forces behind the surge in renewable energy investment is the growing recognition of the urgent need to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems serve as stark reminders of the consequences of unchecked carbon emissions. Governments, businesses, and investors alike are increasingly acknowledging the imperative to transition to a low-carbon economy to safeguard the planet for future generations. Moreover, advancements in renewable energy technologies have made them more cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuels. The plummeting costs of solar panels and wind turbines, coupled with innovations in energy storage and grid integration, have significantly reduced the financial barriers to renewable energy adoption. As a result, renewable energy projects are increasingly seen as economically viable investments with attractive returns. In recent years, governments worldwide have been setting ambitious targets to achieve carbon neutrality within specific timeframes.

    'In recent years, tech giant Google has faced increasing scrutiny over its dominance in various digital markets, ranging from online search to digital advertising. Now, the company finds itself at the center of a global antitrust storm as multiple governments around the world file lawsuits alleging anti-competitive practices and monopolistic behaviour. The European Union, the United States, Australia, and other countries have all launched investigations and legal actions against Google, signaling a coordinated effort to rein in the company power and promote fair competition in the digital economy. At the heart of these antitrust lawsuits are allegations that Google has abused its dominant position in online search and digital advertising to stifle competition, restrict consumer choice, and harm innovation. Critics argue that Google control over search results and advertising revenue gives it an unfair advantage over rivals, making it difficult for smaller companies to compete on a level playing field. In the European Union, Google has been the target of multiple antitrust investigations and fines in recent years. The European Commission, the EU antitrust watchdog, has accused Google of prioritizing its own services and products in search results, while demoting rival offerings, thereby stifling competition and harming consumers. Google has been fined billions of euros for these anti-competitive practices, and the legal battles continue as the company appeals the decisions. In the United States, Google is facing antitrust lawsuits from both the Department of Justice (DOJ) and a coalition of state attorneys general. The DOJ lawsuit, filed in October 2020, alleges that Google has unlawfully maintained monopolies in online search and search advertising through exclusionary agreements and anticompetitive conduct. The lawsuit seeks to break up Google dominance and restore competition in the digital marketplace. Similarly, a group of state attorneys general filed a separate lawsuit against Google, accusing the company of engaging in anti-competitive practices to maintain its monopoly power. The lawsuit, which includes bipartisan support from 38 states and territories, focuses on Google control over online advertising and its impact on publishers, advertisers, and consumers. Australia has also taken action against Google, proposing new regulations to address the company dominance in online search and advertising. The proposed laws, known as the News Media Bargaining Code, aim to level the playing field between tech platforms like Google and news publishers by requiring them to negotiate fair compensation for the use of news content. Google initially opposed the legislation but eventually reached agreements with several Australian media companies to pay for their content. In response to the mounting legal challenges, Google has defended its business practices, arguing that its services benefit consumers and promote competition. The company contends that it faces robust competition in all of its markets and that its products and services have led to innovation, choice, and lower prices for consumers. However, critics remain sceptical of Google arguments, pointing to its dominant market share in online search and advertising as evidence of anti-competitive behaviour. They argue that Google control over the digital ecosystem gives it undue influence over the flow of information and commerce, raising concerns about privacy, data protection, and the fairness of online competition. As the antitrust lawsuits against Google continue to unfold, the outcomes could have far-reaching implications for the future of the digital economy. If successful, the legal actions could lead to structural changes in how tech platforms operate and could pave the way for greater competition and innovation in online markets. However, the complex nature of the cases and the deep pockets of tech companies like Google ensure that the legal battles will likely drag on for years to come.',

    'The Middle East, a region already fraught with geopolitical complexities, is once again facing escalating tensions that pose a significant threat to stability. Recent developments, including territorial disputes, proxy conflicts, and diplomatic standoffs, have heightened concerns among global leaders and observers about the potential for further instability and conflict in the region. One of the primary sources of tension in the Middle East is the ongoing rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. This longstanding feud, rooted in historical, religious, and ideological differences, has manifested in various proxy conflicts across the region, including in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq. The competition for regional dominance between these two powers has exacerbated sectarian divides and fuelled sectarian violence, exacerbating the humanitarian crises in these conflict-ridden countries. In addition to the Iran-Saudi Arabia rivalry, the Middle East is also grappling with the aftermath of the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The reimposition of economic sanctions on Iran by the U.S. has strained Tehran relations with Washington and its European allies, contributing to heightened tensions in the region. Iran subsequent breaches of the JCPOA nuclear restrictions have further escalated tensions and raised concerns about the possibility of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a perennial source of tension and instability in the Middle East. The recent wave of violence in Jerusalem and Gaza, sparked by clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian protesters, has reignited fears of a broader escalation of hostilities. The lack of progress towards a lasting peace agreement and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories have only deepened the sense of mistrust and animosity between the two sides. Meanwhile, the ongoing civil war in Syria, now in its eleventh year, continues to exact a devastating toll on the Syrian population and exacerbate regional tensions. The involvement of foreign powers, including Russia, Turkey, and Iran, has turned Syria into a battleground for competing interests, with each side backing various factions and militias. The humanitarian crisis in Syria, characterized by widespread displacement, violence, and human rights abuses, remains one of the most pressing challenges facing the international community. Moreover, the recent resurgence of violence in Iraq, particularly in the disputed territories of Kirkuk and Sinjar, has raised concerns about the potential for renewed sectarian conflict in the country. The presence of various armed groups, including Kurdish militias and Iranian-backed paramilitary forces, further complicates efforts to achieve stability and reconciliation in post-conflict Iraq. Amidst these tensions, the risk of unintended escalation and miscalculation remains high, raising fears of a wider conflagration in the region. Any further deterioration of the security situation in the Middle East could have far-reaching consequences, not only for the countries directly involved but also for global energy markets, maritime security, and the broader geopolitical landscape. In response to these challenges, international actors, including the United Nations, the European Union, and regional organizations such as the Arab League and the Gulf Co-operation Council, have called for dialogue, de-escalation, and diplomatic solutions to address the root causes of conflict in the Middle East. However, achieving lasting peace and stability in the region will require sustained efforts, political will, and a commitment to addressing the underlying grievances and aspirations of the peoples of the Middle East. As tensions continue to simmer and new flashpoints emerge, the international community must remain vigilant and proactive in its efforts to prevent further escalation and promote peace and stability in the Middle East. Failure to do so risks not only exacerbating the humanitarian crises already gripping the region but also undermining global security and prosperity in an increasingly interconnected world.',
    
    'THE UNITED STATES must strike back at the authors of a drone attack against a remote U.S. military outpost in north eastern Jordan, which killed three U.S. Army reservists and wounded more than 40 others. Devastating retaliation is imperative for several reasons to mete out justice for the fallen U.S. troops, to reduce the military capability of Iranian-backed militias that conducted the attack 4 and to deter those groups from trying again. We assume President Biden is planning such a response. And we assume it will be swift, but not hasty 4 and guided by intelligence, which is needed to identify the responsible faction within the Iranian-backed Shiite militia group known as Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which claimed credit for the attack. A tough response is needed to send a signal of support for the base host nation, Jordan, whose sovereignty was blatantly violated. Yet the administration also needs to use this moment for some stocktaking about recent U.S. deterrence of the groups ultimate backer, Iran; and that record is mixed. Mr. Biden team deserves credit for helping prevent 4 so far 4 the worst-case scenario, all-out regional conflict, which many feared after Hamas massacre in Israel on Oct. 7. U.S. policy has helped stave off full-scale war on the Israel-Lebanon border, partly by deploying a massive naval force to deter Iran proxy Hezbollah and partly by persuading the Israelis not to launch a pre-emptive strike. However, the United States finds itself stuck in an inconclusive fight with the Yemen-based Houthis, having failed to stop that militia missile and drone attacks on global shipping with airstrikes. The attack in Jordan was just the most recent in a wave of approximately 150 such air raids since Oct. 7, targeting a U.S. ground presence that includes 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria to contain Islamic State militants. This does not mean the time has come to strike Iranian assets within Iran 4 as some, including Republicans eager to brand the president as soft on the Islamic republic, are urging. That would be unprecedented in the long history of U.S. Iranian conflict and would mark a dramatic escalation without necessarily proving decisive. A better option would be to hit Iran hard, and directly, but outside its own territory, along with going after the proxy militias. This could be done by striking Iran Revolutionary Guard forces in Syria, Iraq or Yemen. Meanwhile, the Biden administration should take all needful steps to shore up the defenses for U.S. troops in the region, and to correct whatever combination of technical failure and human error led to the drone penetrating U.S. defenses in Jordan. Whatever course for retaliation the administration chooses, it would also be best if Mr. Biden kept congressional leaders informed ahead of time, in keeping with the spirit of the 1973 War Powers Resolution.',

    'In a region, when the population is subdivided as per the age groups this is called the age structure of the population. Age structure is useful for the projection of population and for understanding the dynamics of the age structure arrangement. Similarly, it also helps in understanding the proportion of active and dependent population. In India, the productive population is the population between the ages. This group of people is active in service and business. They directly participate in the economic activities of a region. In regions where the proportion of this population is more, especially youth, development is rapid. The dependant population fall into two sub groups. The people below 15 years of age are totally dependent on the productive population. People above 60 years also fall in the dependant category but their knowledge and experience make them a valuable asset to the whole society. The population of a region can be classified into working a nonworking group. These people who are not in jobs or professions, despite being in the productive age group, come under the nonworking group. This nonworking group is dependent on the working group. If the proportion of working population is higher in a region, then the population is termed as industrious. Such a region has repaid development. Students-teacher relationship, prejudice and racism are the major themes of the novel. Braithwaite gets a job of a teacher in a rather rough and notorious school. He finds that the students belong to a background that is not suitable for learning and their overall developmint and progress. He notices that the students are in no mood to change their attitude and behaviour. Braithwaite with his novel and creative ideas, innovative techniques and understanding the students psychology, ultimately wins their hearts in no time. Though he was bullied, harassed, mentally and physically tortured many times, he did not lose his patience and continued implementing his novel ideas and techniques that helped him to bring a significant change in his students lives. The racism prevalent in Great Britain during the mid the time period during which To Sir, with Love takes place, is of primary significance in the novel. The narrator cites repeated incidents in which he experiences the racism of white Britons, including encounters on the bus, at job interviews, at Greenslade school, when searching for housing, at a restaurant with his girlfriend and so on. At the outsit, Braithwaite is struck by the unexpectedness of such prejudice. He was brought up in British Guiana and he viewed himself.',
    
    'These are characteristic clouds which are indicators of thunderstorm. These look like huge mountains. These are dense and dark in colour. There is thunder accompanied by lightening. They bring rain with storm and may sometime bring hailstones. But such a type of rain does not last long. The largest of these clouds bring rainfall accompanied with lightning. The top portion of these clouds has an anvil like shape. The clouds have a positive charge at the upper and negative charge at the lower end. The land below them always has negative charge. Due to difference in the charges, electric chargers are formed and lighting occur lighting up the sky for a moment. The air around the lighting rises up because of the heat and this leads to a large thundering sound. As compared to other clouds, the rain drops of these clouds are larger because they move up and down a lot of times and accumulate more and more water. Drops become larger and larger and are unable to float in the clouds because of their weight. They fall in the form of rain. Sometimes, the air in the clouds is very cold. As a result, these drops freeze and fall in the form of hail. We call them hailstones. Raindrops coming towards the earth are stopped in the clouds itself because of strong vertical winds which change into hail.

    'All of us now what rubber is. We see rubber types. We play games with rubber balls; we wear rubber shoes during the rainy season. We also use sometimes small pieces of rubber to erase mistakes in writing. Rubber is an interesting substance. It changes its shape when we press it. As soon as we stop pressing it, it springs back to its first shape. We, therefore, say that rubbers elastic. It bounces too. When we throw a rubber ball on the ground, it bounces. Rubber is also water proof. We call a thing waterproof when water cannot get through it. These qualities have made rubber very useful in modern life. We get rubber from rubber tress. These trees give a milk white juice. It is obtained by cutting the bark of the trees. The juice that comes out is gathered in cups. These cups are attached to the trees. Rubber trees grow only in countries where it is very hot. So it was in these countries that people searched for rubber trees. In recent years rubber of successful attempts have been made. Desert Vegetation: These climatic conditions are reflected in the landscape by a characteristic type of vegetation cover. Contrary to popular impression, very few parts of the deserts are entirely barren. Such bare places do occur, but they are rare. Even the grate sandy deserts have a scattering of drought-resistant shrubs in the hollows between the dunes, and where water seepage brings moisture near the surface the result is a profusion of plants. The typical desert scene includes a cover of low shrubs and grasses, which at least after a rain, gives the landscape a distinctly greenish tinge. The vegetation that can exist under these extreme conditions of drought and high evaporation must be especially adapted to them. This accomplished in various ways. The annuals evade the drought by lying dormant during the long dry period, springing into bloom and rapidly completing the life cycle during the rare intervals when water is available. Then there are the perennials which endure the drought, quickly sending forth leaves and stems during the periods of rain, but remaining brown and apparently dead as long as no moisture reaches them. There are also the succulent plants, such as the cacti, these resist the drought by storing water inside their roots and stems, protecting themselves from evaporation by thick bark, by narrow hairy, or waxy leaves, or by a complete absence of leaves. Such plants are protected also from the attacks of thirsty animals by an armament of thorns. Desert plants usually grow some distance apart and have a remarkable development of the root system-both laterally to catch the infrequent rains',
    
    'Amidst escalating conflicts and the worsening impacts of climate change, the world is facing a deepening hunger crisis as food supplies become increasingly disrupted. Across continents, millions of people are struggling to access nutritious food, with vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of these interconnected crises.

Armed conflicts and violence have not only displaced millions of people but have also disrupted agricultural activities, destroyed infrastructure, and hindered humanitarian aid delivery. As a result, food insecurity levels have reached alarming levels, with millions facing severe hunger and malnutrition. In Yemen, the ongoing civil war has plunged the country into one of the world worst humanitarian crises. The conflict has decimated agricultural production, disrupted food distribution networks, and left millions of Yemenis on the brink of starvation. According to the United Nations, more than 20 million people in Yemen are food insecure, with over 16 million in need of urgent assistance to survive. Similarly, in Syria, nearly a decade of conflict has devastated the country agricultural sector, leading to widespread food shortages and soaring prices. Millions of Syrians are unable to afford basic food items, pushing them further into poverty and hunger. The situation is exacerbated by the displacement of millions of people within the country and the influx of refugees into neighbouring countries, placing additional strain on already limited resources. In South Sudan, protracted conflict, coupled with climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods, has exacerbated food insecurity and malnutrition. Nearly half of the population, or approximately 6.5 million people, are facing acute hunger, with millions dependent on humanitarian aid for survival. The situation is particularly dire for children, with many suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Beyond conflict zones, the impacts of climate change are exacerbating food insecurity and pushing vulnerable communities to the brink of starvation. Erratic weather patterns, prolonged droughts, floods, and extreme temperatures are disrupting agricultural production, destroying crops, and diminishing livestock, particularly in regions already prone to food insecurity. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, recurring droughts are threatening food supplies and livelihoods, leaving millions of people without enough to eat. In East Africa, the recent locust infestation has further exacerbated food shortages, posing a significant threat to food security in the region. In Asia, countries like Bangladesh and India are grappling with the impacts of climate change on food production, particularly in coastal areas vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Cyclones, floods, and saline intrusion are destroying crops and jeopardizing food supplies, pushing vulnerable communities deeper into poverty and hunger. Addressing the global hunger crisis requires urgent and coordinated action from the international community. Humanitarian organizations are working tirelessly to provide food assistance, nutrition support, and livelihood opportunities to affected populations. However, these efforts are hindered by funding shortages, logistical challenges, and access constraints in conflict-affected areas. In addition to short-term relief efforts, long-term solutions are needed to address the root causes of food insecurity, including conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and climate adaptation measures. Investing in sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems, and social protection programs can help build the resilience of communities and reduce their vulnerability to future crises. The global hunger crisis is a stark reminder of the urgent need for collective action to address the intersecting challenges of conflict, climate change, and food insecurity. As the world grapples with these complex issues, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable and marginalized communities must remain a top priority to ensure a future where no one goes hungry.',
    
    'The people were tall in stature, remarks Huian Tsang. they were always grateful for any kindness done to them. They were faithful and honest and always kept their promise. They lived simple lives and were generally vegetarian. Respectable persons did not eat onions or garlic. Women moved about freely in society; there was not purdah. Most of the people preferred clothes which were white and fresh looking. Women wore long robes. The caste system was strong and rigid as ever and the Shudras were not treated well. Large contributions in money and kind were made to the monasteries by the people. Harsha royal kitchens provided food for a thousand Buddhists and five hundred Brahmans every day. A village was the smallest unit of the community. It was generally self-sufficient. Harsha became a Buddhist in last life, but he continued to worship Lord Shiva and the Sun God, Surya. Each five years, he went on a pilgrimage to Prayag. While there, he gave everything he had. Collection of evidence in evaluation is followed by its analysis and interpretation which make matters still worse. This may be attributed to the blinkered approach chiefly followed by its users. While analysing evidence, its context is often ignored. Not only that, even the richness of the inputs is ignored and often background of a learner is disregarded. Similarly, while interpreting evidence we tend to forget the basic assumptions of the scale that is employed for assessing students on a hundred- and one-point scale. That is, on this scale zero is not an absolute zero, nor is hundred the absolute hundred; that zero does not represent nothingness of an attribute and that hundred does not represent the acquisition of the subject to the level of mastery; that the entire scale from zero to hundred is divided into hundred units of unequal sizes, that the difference between any two consecutive units does not remain the same as we move from the left to the right side of the scale. To top it all what is even worse is that an individual’s performance is always viewed vis-a-vis the performance or his or her peer group. Other equally significant aspects like students performance with reference to his or her own self and also with reference to the criteria laid down in terms of expected levels of attainments are not taken into consideration. In preceding paragraphs, we have also talked about two vital variables which too have far-reaching consequences in testing of human potential. They are; the quality of instruments and the efficiency of observers. Let us take them one by one. The quality of test papers is invariable questioned because of their varying difficulty values',
    
    'None but a fool is always right. We must be knowing people who always claim to be right. However fanciful, irrelevant or absurd their views on a subject may be, they assert they are right and are not prepared to brook any contradiction of challenge. Their cocksureness makes them presumptuous and this nature destroys all possibilities of acquiring knowledge. The first step towards knowledge is the realisation of ones ignorance. How can a person who does not realise his ignorance ever be curious to acquire knowledge. He contemptuously looks upon all opinions that differ from what he says and denies himself all possibilities of learning anything new. He is convinced that others are wrong while he is right. Then he fails to learn what is actually right. Darkness cannot be light, but unless a person realises that he is wallowing in darkness, he can have no desire of going into light. Wisdom ever keeps away from such a person. He is doomed to unrelieved folly. A question that is often asked by people is, why in we have not changed from numerical all these years marking to grading. The answer to that would seem to be: when a discipline originates it starts with a rudimentary knowledge which gradually traverses towards precision and improvement. Another answer could be ignorance, inertia and lack of will. When we resorted to the use of numerical marking system, our understanding of the subject was nominal. The only consideration at that point of time was to quantity students performance for the purpose of arriving at a variety of decisions. This gave rise to the development of an internal scale with a minimum of zero on the side and a maximum of hundred on the other side of the scale with the assumption that the entire scale is divided into hundred units of equal size. This found favour and over the years it was so institutionalized that people found it difficult to accept that student’s achievement can be expressed in any other form than the numerical marks. This was the time when there was little understanding of the significance of a balanced question paper, intra and inter-examiner variability, factors contributing to error in measurement, content validity, reliability criterion-referenced measurement, self-referenced measurement, norm referenced measurement, in adequacies and imperfection of interval scale etc. with the passage of time, new ideas emerged. Attempts were initiated to perfect evaluation procedures. Measurement and evaluation emerged as a separate discipline. It attached the best of the minds and of them, some had very solid the background',
    
    'The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. I am filled with wonder when I consider the immeasurable contrasts between the two lives which it connects. It was the third of March, 1887, three months before I was seven years old. On the afternoon of that eventful day, I stood on the porch, dumb and expectant. I guessed vaguely from my mothers signs and from the ferrying to and for in the house that something unusual was about to happen, so I went to the door and waited on the steps. The afternoon sun penetrated the mass of honey suckle that covered the porch, and fell on my upturned face. My fingers lingered almost unconsciously on the familiar loaves and blossoms which had just come forth to greet the sweet Southern spring. I did not know what the future held of marvel or surprise for me. Anger and bitterness had preyed upon me continually for weeks and a deep languer had succeeded this passionate struggle. Have you over been at sea in a donse fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in, and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line, and you waited with beating heart for something to happen. I was like that ship before my education began. India is a land of villages. A major portion of our population lives in villages. Cities are few. Obviously, the prosperity of our nation depends upon the prosperity of our villages. Since Independence, Indian villages have undergone quite a lot of change, but there is much more that needs to be done. Villages still face problems like illiteracy, poverty, unemployment and scarcity of water and electricity. During the freedom struggle, Gandhiji had called upon students to go to the villages and work for the upliftment of the villagers. But a student can act only as a part time social worker. He cannot make changes in the law or influence the basic structure of the village. This has to be done by the Government. For rural development, education is of the utmost importance. Many villages lack schools and teachers. Teachers must be given incentives to go and teach in the villages, and regular checks must be kept on the quality of teaching. Health care is very important',
    
    'Each student can get lifelong education. The student will get the information and knowledge from formal and informal education system. Every student has aspiration for new knowledge and he tries for it. The awareness of self learning is essential to provide the proper direction to these efforts made by the student. To do this ultimately the responsibility lies on teacher. Teachers role is more important in the process of self learning. Reading ability and activity of the student can change by self learning. Through self learning the cognitive, affective and psychomotor ability of the student can change. It is useful for making effective teaching learning process. The student can apply this knowledge in day today life. The physical, social, moral and aesthetic development of student is caused by self learning. It helps to speed the personality development of the student. The student establishes the positive effective communication through it. The teacher has to create the conductive situation in school environment, students awareness of learning for effective, joyful education process. The relations are built among the student and teacher in respect of physical infrastructure and education system by providing these amenities for education of self learning and regular studies. The teacher-taught relationship has undergone tremendous change in recent years. Materialism has stuck deep roots in our thoughts and our teachers are more concerned about their own prospects than about those of their students. As a result, the student feels let down and confused, unable to find anyone to give him proper guidance. Mal administration of academic institutions is also responsible for indiscipline among students. We cannot neglect the effects of mass-media on the students. With the fast developing means of communication the world is coming closer day by day and the developments in one corner of the globe do not fail to effect others. If a student-led revolution takes place in some country, their actions will naturally influence their counterparts in India. Students have been in the fore-front in bringing about political upheavals in different parts of the world, and no wonder, the Indian students feel they can do something similar here too. Student unrest is a social problem. It is to be tackled by responsible leaders and public-spirited men of society. The important remedy to the problem is that efforts should be made to increase opportunities of employment and education should be, as such, geared towards more of professional career than mere academic persuits. Academic environment should be improved.',
    
    'In the wake of widespread social justice movements advocating for equality and inclusion, major companies across various industries are stepping up their efforts to promote diversity and foster inclusive workplace environments. Recognizing the importance of addressing systemic inequalities, these companies are implementing new initiatives and policies aimed at creating more equitable opportunities for employees from diverse backgrounds. From tech giants to financial institutions and beyond, companies are acknowledging the need for meaningful action to combat discrimination and promote diversity at all levels of their organizations. The renewed focus on diversity and inclusion comes amid heightened awareness of racial and gender disparities, spurred by movements such as Black Lives Matter and #MeToo. One notable example of corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion is seen in the technology sector. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have announced ambitious initiatives to increase the representation of underrepresented groups, particularly in leadership roles. These initiatives include targeted recruitment efforts, diversity training programs, and mentorship opportunities for employees from marginalized communities. Google, for instance, has pledged to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in leadership positions and has allocated significant resources to support diversity initiatives within the company. Microsoft has also made diversity and inclusion a top priority, with CEO Satya Nadella emphasizing the importance of creating an inclusive culture where all employees feel valued and respected. In the financial sector, major banks and investment firms are also ramping up their efforts to promote diversity and inclusion. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America are among the companies that have announced initiatives to address racial and gender disparities within their organizations. These initiatives include hiring targets for underrepresented groups, diversity training for employees, and support for minority-owned businesses. Goldman Sachs, for example, recently announced a $10 billion initiative to invest in businesses owned by Black women over the next decade. The initiative aims to address the longstanding barriers faced by Black women entrepreneurs and promote economic empowerment within marginalized communities. Beyond the tech and financial sectors, companies in industries ranging from retail to healthcare are also making strides toward greater diversity and inclusion. Retail giant Walmart, for instance, has implemented diversity training programs for its employees and has committed to increasing the representation of women and people of colour in leadership positions. Similarly, healthcare companies like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer are prioritizing diversity and inclusion in their workforce initiatives. These companies have implemented diversity recruiting strategies, mentorship programs for employees from underrepresented groups, and initiatives to address healthcare disparities among marginalized communities. The shift toward greater diversity and inclusion in corporate America reflects a growing recognition of the benefits of a diverse workforce. Research has shown that diverse teams are more innovative, productive, and better equipped to solve complex problems. By embracing diversity and creating inclusive workplace cultures, companies not only enhance their bottom line but also contribute to broader social progress. However, while many companies are taking positive steps toward diversity and inclusion, there is still much work to be done. Achieving true equality and representation requires ongoing commitment and sustained effort from all stakeholders. Companies must continue to prioritize diversity and inclusion in their hiring practices, promotion decisions, and organizational culture to create truly equitable workplaces. In conclusion, major companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace and are taking concrete steps to address systemic inequalities. By implementing initiatives aimed at increasing the representation of underrepresented groups and fostering inclusive cultures, these companies are not only strengthening their own organizations but also contributing to broader efforts to promote equality and social justice.',
    
    'Advertising renders large-scale production possible by creating demand on a wider scale as compared with the individual efforts of salesmen. Many a times, the publicity program are undertaken simultaneously with the embarking of a new venture; and thus, advertising paves the way for quicker distribution which in its turn facilitates the production in advance and on a large scale. Advertising, in a way helps reducing prices for the consumers through the lowering of cost of production. The demand stimulated by advertising, induces manufacturers and investors to undertake greater and larger production of the popular articles which means working under increasing returns and with economics of large scale functioning. Large scale production is necessarily a cheaper production. It not only helps reducing prices, but also reduces the fluctuations in prices as many a times standard products are advertised, disclosing the prices. This is particularly true of branded articles. Manufactures attempt to win over the retailers by publishing the prices so that there will be no scope for any cheating by the sellers. Once the prices are known, the competing retail merchants cannot sell at varying prices. Advertising benefits the industry by lessening the of distribution because it does away with the necessity. Secondary Market is a market where securities are traded. It is a place which provides liquidity to the securities issued in the Primary Market. The secondary market is represented by the stock exchange which provides an organised market place for investors to buy and sell securities. In other words, trading of securities subsequent to its primary offering takes place in secondary market. The secondary market induce investors to continuously rearrange their investments if they wish so. The initial buyer in the Primary Market may re-offer his securities to any interested buyer at mutually acceptable price. The stock exchange provides a market place where such mutually acceptable price may be determined. This active role of Secondary Market promoters growth of the Primary Market and encourages capital formation because investors in the primary market are assured of continuous and ready market for their investment. They can liquidate their securities in the stock exchange at any time.',
    
    'While conventional wisdom has it that a person is in a far stronger position if he is in a job, it may not always guarantee that he looks at the widest choice of options. The major cause of employment is the insufficient expansion of opportunities of work in relation to the increasing population of the country. In view of the underdeveloped conditions of the country, this deficiency can be made up only by a vigorous, adequate and many-sided programme of economic development. The problem of unemployment should therefore be tackled on all front and, more practically, by the organised growth of cottage and village industries, on an efficient basis as well as by other production and development schemes, which utilised this labour, increasing the purchasing power of the people, and add to general production. The problem of employment for those who receive education in schools and colleges is also becoming difficult. The number of such persons has increased out of proportion to the possible opening of the kind sought by them in present conditions, and the quality and kind of education which they receive is in many cases, not wall adapted to the present requirements. The educational system should, be recognised from this point of view. When writing a cheque a few simple precautions should be taken to avoid forgery. Both the name of the person to whom the cheque is drawn, and the amount in words and figures should begin as far as possible to the left, so that no words or figures can be fraudulently inserted. A line should be rules in any blank spaces remaining after the words and figures. Apart from its usefulness as a means of keeping a record of spending, the habit of making payments by cheque has many advantages. The payment of accounts is simplified, there is no necessity to go to the post office for postal orders to registered envelopes when sending money by post. Further, while a cheque does not constitute a legal receipt, it affords a valuable evidence that the payment has been made. A cheque book should always be kept in a safe place, but if it should be lost or stolen the customer should notify the bank at once so that arrangements can be made to protect his interests. Similarly the bank must be advised if an individual cheque is lost, stolen or mislaid. Unless prior arrangements have been made with the bank for an account to be overdrawn, under no circumstances should a cheque be drawn which exceeds the amount of the balance standing to his credit. A crossed cheque will not be paid out across the counter. Some is to be deposited.',
    
    'The old cities were never built to accommodate such a great movement from the rural areas and small towns. The sudden enlargement of residential areas has not been much planned. With the expansion of cities many slums that were on the periphery of the city are now in the midst of developed areas. Affluence and poverty side by side seems a good adjustment. But the health hazards have not been limited to the hut; they are immediately affected in the better localities too. An epidemic that starts in slums snowballs into the city as well. Moreover, the slums are so conjusted, and the amenities are so little, that the dwellers are generally on a warpath against one another near water taps. With all its intellectualism and modern living, urbanisation is responsible for artificiality, breaking of family ties, and utter loss of emotional relations. Freedom from the bondage of old customs and superstitious is welcome. But the vagaries of addiction to drugs and psychological problems in the material word of big cities cannot be underestimated. Environmental pollution due to automobiles had added one more misery to the vast expansion of cities. A young man who moves to the city for education would not like to go back to the rural setting to lead a rough and coarse life. Thus the education concentrate in the cities. India is a land of villages. A major portion of our population lives in villages. Cities are few. Obviously, the prosperity of our nation depends upon the prosperity of our villages. Since Independence, Indian villages have undergone quite a lot of change, but there is much more that needs to be done.

    'Cleanliness is next to Godliness - Certainly this is a duty, not a sin. It is absolutely necessary for ones self-respect. A person who is clean and tidy in how the dresses up commands better respect from those around him than the one who has a slovenly and unkempt appearance. It is extremely essential for each of us to keep ourselves, our houses and neighbourhood clean. This is necessary for ones and the nations health and hygiene. Dirt and grime are the causes of ill health and suffering, giving rise to diseases and epidemics. Plagues and epidemics that set in are called by filthy and insanitary unhygienic conditions. So it the duty of every citizen to ensure that public places and our own surroundings are not littered. A great percentage of our population live below the poverty line. The slums in metropolitan areas are inhabited by these poor people, most of whom have migrated from villages. Unable to earn a decent means of living. They live in shacks and huts, having no proper sanitation or drinking water. The one or two pipes that they have is surrounded by filth and stagnan water infested with mosquitoes and other creatures. Pigs, cows, dogs, etc. add to the filthy conditions. Now-a-days our Government also taking remarkable steps to maintain cleanliness especially in public places. The pattern of energy consumption in rural areas is important in any understanding of rural energy developments. With this end in view, let us examine the type of energy usage that takes place in the rural areas. Human Society acts on nature to produce either food or goods which are then consumed. Unlike animals, human beings not only acquire but also transform natural produce. Any such transformation requires energy as a necessary input. Energy and production always go hand in hand. Higher the level of production, higher generally is the level of energy utilisation. In this context, electricity, oil and coal are the common commercial energy sources which are being used in rural areas. Rural electrification was set as an important social goal in the India planning process. It was felt that the impact of electrification should not be considered in terms of narrow economic cost benefits but looked upon as an investment in terms of modernisation for the rural areas',
    
    'In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work has emerged as a transformative force, reshaping not only how people work but also where they choose to live. As companies embrace flexible work arrangements and employees seek greater work-life balance, urban planning, and real estate markets are experiencing significant shifts to accommodate these remote work trends. 1) Urban Planning Adaptations: Cities around the world are reevaluating their urban planning strategies to accommodate the growing demand for remote work-friendly environments. One notable trend is the emphasis on creating mixed-use developments that integrate residential, commercial, and recreational spaces within proximity. This approach reduces the need for long commutes and fosters vibrant, walkable communities where residents can live, work, and play. Moreover, urban planners are prioritizing the development of green spaces, public parks, and outdoor amenities to enhance the quality of life for remote workers. Access to nature and recreational opportunities has become increasingly important as people seek environments that support their physical and mental well-being, especially in light of prolonged periods spent indoors during lockdowns. Additionally, there is a growing focus on improving digital infrastructure, including high-speed internet connectivity and smart technology integration, to support remote work capabilities. Cities are investing in upgrading broadband networks and implementing digital initiatives to ensure reliable internet access and facilitate remote collaboration and communication. Impact on Real Estate Markets: The shift towards remote work has had a profound impact on the real estate market, driving changes in housing preferences and demand patterns. Suburban and rural areas are experiencing a surge in popularity as remote workers seek larger homes with dedicated office spaces, outdoor areas, and access to nature. As a result, there is a growing trend of urban dwellers relocating to less densely populated areas in search of affordable housing, better quality of life, and a quieter environment conducive to remote work. This has led to increased demand for single-family homes, townhouses, and rural properties, driving up prices in suburban and exurban markets. Conversely, some urban areas are facing challenges as demand for downtown apartments and condominiums wanes. High-rise buildings and densely populated urban cores are seeing decreased occupancy rates and declining rental prices as remote workers seek more spacious and affordable housing options outside of city centres. Furthermore, the rise of remote work has spurred a re-evaluation of office space needs, with many companies downsizing their physical footprints or adopting flexible office arrangements. Commercial real estate markets are grappling with vacancies and changing tenant preferences, prompting landlords to repurpose office buildings for mixed-use developments or alternative uses such as residential conversions or co-working spaces. 2) Future Implications: The remote work revolution is expected to have long-term implications for urban planning and real estate markets. As remote work becomes more entrenched in the post-pandemic era, cities will continue to adapt and evolve to meet the needs of remote workers and their families. Urban planners will need to prioritize sustainability, connectivity, and quality of life in designing future cities and neighbourhoods. Investments in public transportation, green infrastructure, and digital connectivity will be essential to support remote work and promote equitable access to opportunities for all residents. In the real estate market, developers and investors will need to respond to shifting demand dynamics by diversifying their portfolios and focusing on innovative, adaptable spaces that cater to the evolving needs of remote workers. Flexibility, affordability, and accessibility will be key drivers of success in the post-pandemic real estate landscape. In conclusion, the remote work trends reshaping urban planning and real estate markets represent a paradigm shift in how we live, work, and interact with our built environment. By embracing these changes and proactively addressing the evolving needs of remote workers, cities and real estate markets can thrive in the digital age.',
    
    'India is a poor country that is mostly constituted of villages. The teeming millions reside in the rural areas here some of the people live even without good potable drinking water. On the other hand, are the large cities that are bursting at their seams with urban population, where the infrastructure is unsuitable to give shelter to all its citizens. In the capital city of Delhi, or the congested city of Mumbai, slums keep mushrooming, for there is a general movement of the masses from the surrounding rural areas to these cities in search of jobs. Unable to find jobs, and nowhere to live, they resort to begging. There is a general belief among foreigners visiting India that begging has been prevalent here for centuries. Not so, it started with the decline of cottage industries when the British ruled India. It was the time when the general poverty in India was at its worst. The British had the people working for them more or less as Slaves, doing all the menial work for them. Very few Indians were in their top hierarchy. This is when begging set in as the destitute had to live on the charity of others, having no income of their own. You can still see beggars in large cities where they live side by side with the rich. Their jhuggijhompris are getting legalised as the politicians seek votes. His original name was Davidas Debuji Maharaj who was born in Shedgaon village in Anjangaon Surji Taluka in Amravati District of Maharashtra to a Dhobi Family. A public teacher, he travelled from one place to another wearing his food pan upturned on his head and carrying his trademark broom. When he entered on village, he would instantly start cleaning the gutters and roads of the village. He also told the citizens of the village that their congratulations would have to wait until his work was done. Villagers gave him money. Babaji used that for progress of physical as well as thinking of society. From the obtained money, Maharaj built educational institutions, dharmashalas, hospitals and animal shelters. He conducted his discourses in the form of Kirtans in which he would emphasize values like service to humanity and compassion. During his Kirtans, he would educate people against blind faiths and rituals. He would use Dohas by Kabir in his discourses.',
    
    'While historical studies discover, describe and interpret what existed in the past, there are other kinds of investigations which study, describe and interpret what exists at present. They are concerned with conditions or relationship that exist, practices that prevail, beliefs, points of view or attitudes that are held, processes that are going on, effects that are being felt and trends that are developing. The literature of such investigations includes expressions like descriptive survey, normative status or trend. The terms survey and status suggest the gathering of evidences relating to current conditions. The term normative implies the determination of normal or typical conditions or practices. The term normative survey, is generally used for the type of research that we intend to consider here and the research which proposes to ascertain what is the normal or typical condition or practice at the present time. The normative survey type of research is not peculiar to education or to other social sciences. It is a signification mode of attack in any field of knowledge where geographic distribution is involved or where the objects of any class very among themselves, that is in studying the climatic conditions of various parts of the world, or the distribution of natural resources. The survey approach to educational problems is one of the most commonly used approaches. Says my author, one of the female figures in the niche is exactly like the Venus de Madici, and so on. But you must remember that everything almost has been destroyed by the iconoclastic Mohammedan; yet the remnants are more than all European debris put together I have travelled eight year and not seen many of the masterpieces. Tell sister Lock also that there is a runined temple in forest in India, which and the Parthenon of Greece, Feggusson considers as the climax of architectural art each of its type the one of conception, the other of conception and detail. The later Mogul buildings etc., the Indo Saracenic architecture, does not compare a bit with best types of the ancients. I feel much obliged or the Bharati sent by you, and consider myself fortunate that the cause to which my humble life has been dedicated has been able to win the approbation of highly a talented ladies like you. In this battle of life, men are rare who encourage the initiator of new thought, not to speak of women who would offer him encouragement, particularly in our unfortunate land. It is therefore that the approbation of an educated Bengali lady is more valuable than the loud applause of all the men of India. May the Lord grant that may women like you be born in this country, and devote their lives to the betterment of their motherland. I have something to say in this regard.',
    
    'After Independence the Government of India passed the Industrial Policy Resolution in 1948. It laid down the pattern of mixed economy specifying the industrial field of public sector and private sector to operate. This Resolution envisaged a mixed economy as suitable basis for the future economic development of the country. Later on the Government of India passed another Industrial Policy Resolution in 1956. It firmly established the principle of mixed economy for achieving the objective of socialistic pattern of society keeping in view all this. The sector owned, controlled and managed by the State is known as public sector. Public sector includes strategic industries such as arms and ammunition, production of atomic energy whose development would be the exclusive responsibility of the State. The state is also responsible for the establishment of basic and key industries, such as coal, iron and steel aircraft manufacturing ship building etc. This is exclusive public sector as well. Noise pollution is an environmental issue that needs to be curbed using stringent measures. Loudspeakers also compound the menace of unchecked noise. Loudspeakers are widely used in cities and smaller towns and have become part and parcel of our life in the present day. They can be heard blaring away at social functions like birthdays, marriage ceremonies or political parties or meetings. The larger the gathering, the louder is the music and the festivities. But the ban of its use after 10 pm. is a blessing for most of the citizens. During public speeches indoors or outdoors, the loudspeaker is a useful gadget, and also a necessity. It helps sound to reach the people sitting quite far away from the podium from where a person is giving his address of speech. During election time, loudspeakers are a common fare during which automobiles and other modes of transport are seen carrying loudspeakers, propagating their parties achievements, and soliciting votes for the candidates. Politicians and party workers are seen addressing rallies or large gatherings using the loudspeakers to reach across to the remote people justifying their party stand, the merits of voting for their party, and so on. In this sense, the loudspeakers is a been. But there is hardly any need to belt out loud music or propaganda songs.',
    
    'As the world continues to grapple with the far-reaching impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a noticeable shift in focus towards addressing mental health challenges exacerbated by the prolonged period of stress and uncertainty. Governments, organizations, and communities worldwide are recognizing the urgent need to prioritize mental well-being and implement comprehensive initiatives to support individuals coping with pandemic-related stressors. The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on mental health globally, with millions of people experiencing heightened levels of anxiety, depression, loneliness, and other psychological distress. The disruption of daily routines, social isolation, economic hardships, and concerns about health and safety have contributed to a significant increase in mental health issues across all age groups and demographics. In response to this crisis, governments and healthcare authorities are ramping up efforts to expand access to mental health services, raise awareness, and promote self-care strategies. One notable trend is the integration of mental health support into broader public health responses to the pandemic. Governments are allocating resources to fund mental health hotlines, online counselling services, and community-based programs aimed at providing emotional support and resources to those in need. Furthermore, there is a growing recognition of the importance of destigmatizing mental illness and encouraging open discussions about mental health issues. Public figures, including celebrities, athletes, and political leaders, are using their platforms to share personal experiences with mental health challenges, reducing the stigma associated with seeking help and treatment. In addition to government-led initiatives, businesses and employers are also stepping up efforts to prioritize employee mental health and well-being. With remote work becoming the new norm for many organizations, employers are implementing policies and programs to support employee mental health while working from home. This includes offering virtual counselling sessions, mental health days, and access to resources for managing stress and anxiety. Schools and Educational institutions are also adapting to the increased mental health needs of students and faculty. Many schools are incorporating mental health education into their curricula, teaching students coping skills, resilience-building techniques, and strategies for managing stress. Additionally, schools are providing access to mental health professionals, support groups, and other resources to ensure that students feel supported and empowered to seek help when needed. Community-based organizations and nonprofits are playing a critical role in bridging gaps in mental health services and reaching underserved populations. From grassroots initiatives to large-scale campaigns, these organizations are providing invaluable support to individuals and families struggling with mental health challenges. They offer a range of services, including peer support groups, crisis intervention, and advocacy efforts to raise awareness and promote mental health literacy. Despite these positive developments, challenges remain in ensuring equitable access to mental health services and addressing systemic barriers to care. Marginalized communities, including people of colour, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living in poverty, face disproportionate barriers to accessing mental health care due to factors such as stigma, discrimination, and lack of resources. Moving forward, policymakers, healthcare providers, and community leaders need to continue working collaboratively to address these disparities and ensure that mental health services are accessible to all who need them. This requires sustained investment in mental health infrastructure, innovative approaches to service delivery, and a commitment to addressing social determinants of mental health. In conclusion, the renewed focus on mental health initiatives in response to pandemic-related stress reflects a growing recognition of the importance of prioritizing mental well-being in public health agendas. By implementing comprehensive strategies to support individuals and communities, we can foster resilience, promote recovery, and build a healthier, more compassionate society for all.',
    
    'The second day attraction was the circus on the moon! One unique feature of the circus was the seating arrangement. The spectators were made to sit in the tent and the circus was going on outside. High jumps and long jumps were the special attractions! One gymnast jumped twenty seven metres high! On both the days, besides the main attractions, much time was reserved for visiting the various settlements there. It was expected that the students should spend some time for self-study. The teacher had assigned them the task of writing an essay on how they spent their time on the moon; which places they visited; what they observed etc. Sayali and her friends had travelled far and wide and had done a lot of sight-seeing. On the third day, their teacher took them to a place of historical importance. A hundred years ago Neil Armstrong had landed at this place. Everyone was looking forward to this visit to the historical monument - it was the oldest place in the history of man on the moon. The first footprint of Neil Armstrong was preserved on the moon land. Beside the footprint was a grand statue of Armstrong. At the base of the statue were carved the first words uttered by a human on the moon, one small step for a man, one giant leap of mankind. The next attraction for the children was that they were going to wear the space suits for the first time. Then they were going to roam outside experiencing the gravitational force of the moon. Be careful when you walk, dear children! Do not run, or sprint, you will fall! The teacher was warning repeatedly, but who was in the mood to listen? They hopped, jumped and ran around. Buy ornaments specially made from the stones on the moon, very cheap, cheaper than those available in the shops in the settlement. Cheaper and better! At least have a look. The roadside shopkeepers screamed at the top of their voice. Buy, sister, buy. I am selling these earrings really cheap, saying this; he approached Sayali and displayed the sets of shining stones earrings. Sayali suddenly remembered her mother. Tomorrow they were to start on their return journey. She had completely forgotten her mother in the last three days. She felt terribly guilty. Only one thousand rupees, replied the salesman. Sayali immediately paid the amount, took the earrings and ran to catch up with her friends.',
    
    'It was Christmas Eve and although it was still afternoon, lights had begun to appear in the shops and houses of the little Russian village, for the short winter day was nearly over. Excited children scurried indoors and now only muffled sounds of chatter and laughter escaped from closed shutters. Old Papa Panov, the village shoemaker, stepped outside his shop to take one last look around. The sounds of happiness, the bright lights and the faint but delicious smells of Christmas cooking reminded him of past Christmas times when his wife had still been alive and his own children little. Now they had gone. His usually cheerful face, with the little laughter wrinkles behind the round steel spectacles, looked sad now. But he went back indoors with a firm step, put up the shutters and set a pot of coffee to heat on the charcoal stove. Then, with a sigh, he settled in his big armchair. Papa Panov did not often read, but tonight he pulled down the big old family Bible and, slowly tracing the lines with one forefinger, he read again the Christmas story. He read how Mary and Joseph, tired by their journey to Bethlehem, found no room for them at the inn, so that Marys little baby was born in the cowshed. Oh, dear, oh, dear! exclaimed Papa Panov, if only they had come here! I would have given them my bed and I could have covered the baby with my patchwork quilt to keep him warm. He read on about the wise men who had come to see the baby Jesus, bringing him splendid gifts. Papa Panov face fell. I have no gift that I could give him, he thought sadly. Then his face brightened. He put down the Bible, got up and stretched his long arms to the shelf high up in his little room. He took down a small, dusty box and opened it. Inside was a perfect pair of tiny leather shoes. Papa Panov smiled with satisfaction. Yes, they were as good as he had remembered the best shoes he had ever made. I should give him those, he decided, as he gently put them away and sat down again. He was feeling tired now, and the further he read the sleepier he became. The print began to dance before his eyes so that he closed them, just for a minute. In no time at all Papa Panov was fast asleep. And as he slept he dreamed. He dreamed that someone was in his room and he knew at once, as one does in dreams, who the person was. It was Jesus.',
    
    'On the Sunday of the 1956 Masters, the day that was to become the most significant in his golf career, Jack Burke went to church. Whatever the nature of his communion with God that morning, since he was eight shots behind the overnight leader Ken Venturi, he probably thought asking for divine intervention was futile. Later, however, having clawed his way through the field, Burke stood over a downhill 30 ft. birdie putt on the 17th green to tie the lead. It was lightning quickly, he recalled. I never hit a putt more softly in my life. I immediately thought, Oh no, I did not get it halfway to the hole. The weather that week was the worst the tournament had experienced in it is than 20 year history. The Masters was being televised for the first time and the 40 mph winds threatened to blow down the TV towers. On Sunday 29 players shot 80 or worse. On another day, Burke ball at the 17th might have finished halfway to the hole, from where two more putts would have been the likely outcome. As it was, nature had other plans. A big gust of wind came up and took the ball with it, Burke said, that ball kept rolling and rolling and rolling until it dropped in the centre of the cup. It was a miracle. When Venturi made his sixth bogey of the day at the 17th, Burke had the lead. At the final hole he made a downhill four-footer to win. His round of 71 was one of only two that beat par. At the start of that week, Burke name was not on anyone lips as a potential champion, not even his own. Although he had won four tournaments in successive weeks in 1952 (a tour record that still stands today) and finished the Masters runner-up that year, he had not won for nearly three years. A few weeks earlier he had even talked about packing it in. He was still only 33. Burke gave thousands of lessons during his life, and some of the biggest names in golf were recipients of his wisdom. But the most important was the one that he gave himself on the eve of that final round at Augusta in 1956. Burke was never considered the greatest ball striker in the game, but with the short stick he had few equals. Over the first three days he thought he had missed too many short putts, and so, on Sunday, he took his palms off the grip of his putter, holding it instead in the tips of his fingers. On greens that the fierce, cold wind had dried to concrete, that Dow Finsterwald said were cut so short you could hear the ball roll, Burke needed just 29 putts, single putting seven greens. No three putts. Arnold Palmer said Burke was always magic on the greens, but especially that Sunday.',
    
    'The house and its surroundings are a sight of peace in the early morning of April. It nestles by the side of a small stream of crystal-clear water. The stream tumbles down the green mountains only two miles or so away. There is a stretch of hundreds of acres of fertile land rolling with yellow mustard flowers, between the mountain range and the house. A garden is in front of the house. Trees of many kinds bearing flowers of various hues and fruits grow on all sides of the house. The courtyard smells of jasmine which blooms in bunches of white pearls. The fragrance mingles with the thin smoke that rises from sweet smelling incense sticks. The burning incense sticks are glowing at the altar of God in the middle of the courtyard. Ashangbi is in her reading-room and is busy writing an article. She is a middle aged mother of three children and a journalist and woman rights activist. Lanthoi, her youngest daughter, enters the room. She is an intelligent girl. Today she looks thoughtful and she takes a seat by her mother side. At the sight of her child, Ashangbi lovingly asks, have you finished your study, my dear? Yes, mother, I finished it last night. Today being Sunday, I want to do something interesting. Lanthoi says and waits for her mother response. Tell me what you want to do, Ashangbi asks her quite amused. Mother, tomorrow I am going to represent the Siroi Lily House as a speaker in a symposium at our school. The topic is God Created Men and Women As Equals. Will you spare some time to have a discussion with me? Lanthoi presses on her mother. Lanthoi has just had a discussion with her father on the topic. Tomba, her father, is a husband supportive of the activities of his wife and a loving father. He is a lawyer and a social worker, who advocates the cause of women. He is always proud of his wife, the two daughters and the son. In times of need, he extends his helping hand to his wife and children and to the society at large. He does not discriminate between a man work and a woman work anywhere. He shares equally with his wife in doing the household chores like cleaning, washing, cooking and feeding the children. Had he not shared in these activities in the way he does, his wife would not have been a successful professional. He wholeheartedly believes in equality irrespective of class, religion and gender. In his discussion with his daughter, he laments over the great injustice done on women in the society, telling her, my dear child, the world is still full of inequalities. We have to find a way to bring equality between men and women.',
    
    'Cotton is obtained from a bushy mallow plant and grows from the surface of seeds in the pods or bolls and so is also called seed hair fiber. The word cotton is derived from and Arabic word quoton which means plant found in the conquered land. It is one of the oldest fibers known to mankind. Its history is more than 5000 years old. India was the principal country in growing cotton and manufacturing cotton fabrics which were well known all over the world. The major cotton producing regions are India. China, America, Brazil, Russia, and Argentina.  In India, it is cultivated on a large scale in South Indian Plateau, i.e. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Cotton is cultivated most satisfactorily in warm, humid climates or in warm climates with adequate irrigation. The deep and black soil is generally most favourable for the cultivation. It grows well in the areas where the amount of rainfall is less but well distributed. Carefully selected cotton seeds are planted in row. Approximately after 100 days, they begin to bloom as creamy white blossoms. These blossoms change to pink and then reddish purple. Within three days their petals fall off, leaving the ripening of seed pod. The fibers growing inside the pod expand it to about 1.5 long and 1 in diameter. It is now known as cotton bowl. The boll bursts open about 50 to 80 m days after the flowering with fleecy white cotton ready for picking. Full grown Cotton plant is about 3 to 6 feet in height. India mainly produces short staple cotton. Recently medium and long staple varieties of cotton like Buri, Laxmi, Varalaxmi, and Devraj are cultivated. Arboreum and Harbacium varieties of cotton produce short, thick, rough but stronger fibers; these varieties are known as desi, Asian or ancient cotton. Gossypium originated in America and possesses greater length and better qualities. Fibers of super fine quality and maximum length are obtained from Barbadense also famous as Egyption cotton. Organic cotton in one of the latest varieties of cotton and is cultivated without using synthetic fertilisers and insecticides. It has great demand in Europian countries. Experiments on growing species of coloured cotton are being done today. B. T. cotton is produced using technique of genetic engineering. Which has improved resistance and for greater production in lesser cost it is cultivated. After the cotton is picked, it is taken to the ginnery. Cotton fibers called as lints are separated and the seeds are removed by the cotton gin. The cotton gin was invented by Eli Whitney in 1794. It subsequently promoted the growth of cotton industry. The modern gins remove foreign matters such as dirt, twigs, leaves and parts of boll.',
    
    'In 18th century due to Industrial revolution in England goods were produced on a large scale. India was a source of big market for raw material and finished goods for the British people. Due to industrial revolution and British policy the small and cottage industries were shut down in India. Artisans and workers became jobless and they turned to agriculture for employment. As a result, the dependency on agriculture was increased. Due to burden on agricultural sector and drought, the condition of the farmer became weak. The debt burden on the farmers was increased and they were stucked in the clutches of moneylenders. To save the farmers from the clutches of moneylender government took legal measures for providing credit facilities. The first co-operative society named as Annyonya Co-operative Society was established on 5th February, 1889 by Vitthal Laxman Kavathekar at Baroda in Mumbai province. The British Government passed the first co-operative act in 1904. This act was the great turning point in economic and social history of Indian farmers. This act was limited only for the formation of Credit co-operative society. In the year 1912, the second Co-operative Act was passed to remove the drawbacks of the 1904 act. This act provides establishment of co-operative societies in all the sectors. The British government appointed a committee to study the progress and drawbacks of co-operative movement under the chairmanship of Edward Maclagan in the year 1914. This committee gave valuable suggestion for future development of the co-operative movement. After the First World War in 1919, the central government passed Montford Reform Act and powers were given to the states for the enactment of separate co-operative Act in their provinces. Accordingly, The Bombay provincial government act was passed in 1925. On the recommendations of the various committees appointed for the reconstruction of the co-operative movement The Reserve Bank of India was established on 1st April, 1935. This bank started the Agricultural credit supply department. During this period, the Central Government appointed the Agricultural Finance Committee (1944) under the chairmanship of Prof. Dhananjayrao Gadgil and in 1945 Co-operative Planning Committee under the chairmanship of Mr. R. G. Sarayya. In 1945 government of India appointed a Rural and Banking Committee under the chairmanship of Shri. Purushottamdas Thakurdas to make recommendations for rural banking facilities and development. In 1951, All India Rural Credit survey Committee was established under the chairmanship of Dr. A.D. Gorewala to study the credit supply in rural areas and to make the recommendation to the government on rural credit. In the year 1954, the committee submitted its report to the government. In this report the committee has mentioned co-operation is unsuccessful but co-operation must be successful. After the independence, the government of India adopted the policy of five-year plan for economic development from the year 1951. During the Five-Year Plan, emphasis was given to increase people participation for development of the co-operative movement.',
    
    'Former United States President Donald Trump appeared to receive a measure of legal succour from the country Supreme Court after it agreed to hear in mid-April the arguments for and against his right, as an erstwhile serving President, to immunity from federal criminal prosecution for allegedly subverting the 2020 presidential election. This means that a trial is unlikely before May and a decision on the case could be returned by the end of June, the time when party rulings for the current session of the court are expected. The court  move adds considerably more time to the calendar of prosecution cases against Mr. Trump, and has effectively spoiled the plans of Special Counsel Jack Smith, leading these cases for the Justice Department, who had urged back in December last year that the Justices immediately take up the case, without any other intermediate court action. Earlier in February, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had ruled that Mr. Trump did not enjoy sweeping immunity from federal prosecution, a legal setback for his defence team, which was appealed. Now, the Supreme Court has ruled that the lower court ruling against Mr. Trump will remain on hold until it decides the issue. In an alternative scenario the Justices might have declined Mr. Trumps request to pause the case, which would have given Mr. Smith the option to proceed more quickly with the prosecution in the election subversion case, improving the odds of a trial before the presidential election in November. There is a plethora of legal cases against Mr. Trump, including four criminal indictments, all of which will be impacted by the timing of the ruling on presidential immunity. Notably, the Supreme Court Justices also appear poised to reverse a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that banned Mr. Trump from being on presidential ballot under a constitutional provision precluding those aiding an insurrection from holding high once in government. Other than the legal morass that looms on the horizon in light of the delaying tactics employed by the Trump defence team, the battle over prosecuting Mr. Trump has laid bare the fault lines in American politics, with voters divided on his capabilities and the potential risks he poses. Democrats and Republicans have come up short in terms of ending any credible alternatives in terms of nationally popular leaders, making the 2024 election Mr. Trump to lose. Therein lies the true malaise at the heart of the American Dream today the lack of a vision that could unite all Americans under a single political banner. This would require leaders who are able to take a long view of the U.S. position as a global power, and one that provides for its entire people regardless of their identity.',
    
    'Indian economy is predominantly a rural economy. Economic growth of the country is driven by its rural development. It is true that India lives in villages. The term rural development is a subset of the broader term development. The term rural development connotes overall development of rural areas with a view to improve the quality of life. According to 2011 census, the country rural population is 83.25 crores (68.8% of total population). There has been a wide consensus that rural development should be inclusive and sustainable in order to alleviate the poverty. The concept of rural development was born in the context of agriculture, and it remained for a long time with agricultural development in India. Rural development is a strategy designed to improve the economic and social life of a specific group of people the rural poor. Rural development involves extending the benefits of development to the poorest among those who seek livelihood in the rural areas. The group includes small-scale farmers, tenants and the landless. The rural population in India is classified into agricultural sector which has been subdivided as agriculture and allied activities. Agriculture consists of small, marginal and large farmers. Allied sector consists of plantation, forestry, fisheries, dairy and horticulture. Industrial sector is defined as an economic activity concerned with the processing of raw materials and manufacture of goods in factories. This sector has been classified into the small scale, cottage and rural industries. The service sector termed as tertiary sector involves provision of services to businesses as well as final consumers such as accounting services, tradesman ship (like mechanic or plumber services), computer services, restaurants, tourism etc. The service sector has been further classified into traders (wholesaler and retailer), transport operators, professional and technical. Rural development in India has witnessed various plans and policies initiated by the government as well as at the non-government levels. Appropriate strategies for rural development will lead to economic growth and development of the country. Rural development helps to improve sanitation and hygiene, providing safe drinking water and affordable health facilities. This would lead to an improvement in the quality of life of the rural people. Literacy is a powerful instrument of socio-economic change. However there is a considerable gap between the rural and urban literacy rates. Rural development helps to bridge this gap by making provisions for educational facilities at all levels. Rural development helps to reduce gender disparity, meet the diverse needs of rural women as well as encourage their participation in community development programmes.',
    
    'The exoneration of former Delhi University professor G.N. Saibaba and five others of the charge of having Maoist links exposes the practice of invoking stringent laws based on nothing more than a person likely association with or sympathy for extremist groups. Their acquittal by the Bombay High Court is not able for giving full meaning to the procedural safeguards that countervail the stringency of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. It also shines a light on the bail denying features of the law that allows the state to imprison suspects for long years even though the evidence backing their arrest is doubtful. In this particular case, five of the accused were arrested in 2013 and continued to be incarcerated since then, and one of them died during the pendency of the appeal. Mr. Saibaba was arrested in 2014. The trial court had convicted the six of them and sentenced five of them to life and awarded a 10 year term to the other. The case will also be remembered for a dubious reason the Supreme Court hasty intervention to stay their discharge by the High Court in 2022. They were discharged on the ground that the sanction given to prosecute them under UAPA was not valid, but an apex court Bench sat the very next morning, a Saturday, to stay the order, and later directed the High Court to pass a fresh judgment on merits. Many had questioned the haste with which the benefit of discharge was reversed. The latest judgment is a complete repudiation of the prosecution case, holding that the seizure effected from the accused was not proved, the material relied upon by the state was inadequate and that there was nothing to link the accused with any terrorist act, conspiracy or membership of any Maoist organisation. It also found that the sanction given under UAPA to five of the accused was invalid because the report of the authority meant to review material against them independently was just a green signal for their prosecution, containing no discussion on the nature of the evidence. Further, the trial court had taken cognisance of the charge sheet against Mr. Saibaba even before the sanction, which came later, had been received. In its discussion on the use of UAPA against the accused, the Court has again emphasised that the more stringent a law is, the greater will be the need to adhere to procedural safeguards the independent review was an additional safeguard introduced in UAPA in 2008. It reiterates the principle that mere possession of literature or publicity material, without any direct evidence linking suspects with a terrorist act, cannot be a ground to convict them under UAPA.',
    
    'The societies which undertake the activity of converting of raw agricultural produce into finished goods and works on co-operative principles are known as processing co-operative societies. For e.g. manufacturing sugar from sugar cane, making spun yarn and cotton bundles out of cotton, producing edible oil from oil seeds etc. If the agricultural goods are processed and then sold, it yields more profit for the farmers and for this reason, formation of processing co-operative societies is very important. In the processing co-operative, co-operative sugar factory is one of the important type in the processing co-operative industries. The sugar factories in Maharashtra have helped for development of rural areas to a large extent. The first co-operative sugar factory in India was established in the year 1933 by the efforts of Rao Bahaddur Late. C. V.  S. Narasimha Raju in Etikoppaka, in Andhra Pradesh. At that time, it had a filtration capacity of 75 tons sugarcane per day. Even today, this factory is in a good working condition. In Maharashtra, the first co-operative sugar factory was formed in Pravaranagar located in Ahmednagar district in the year 1951 due to efforts of Padmashri Dr. Vitthal Rao Vikhe Patil. This factory was built on the lines of modern technology. Out of 316 sugar factories in India, 122 co-operative sugar factories are located in Maharashtra. The members of these co-operative sugar factories are sugarcane growing farmers of those areas where the sugar factories are located. Similarly, primary credit co-operative societies are also given membership. The State Government also contributes in the capital. In this industry, sugar is produced by processing sugarcane. Along with sugar production, sugar factories have also started manufacturing by products. For e.g. scum project, production of gas alcohol, production of electricity, production of ethanol fuel, paper particle board etc. In those places where the facility to produce sugar is not available, there sugarcane is processed to produce jaggery. Jaggery is also in good demand. Hence, jaggery manufacturing business can be undertaken on co-operative basis. The main aim of sugar co-operative factories is to produce sugar from sugarcane on the principles of co-operation and bring in improvement in the financial conditions of the farmers by creating workshops for manufacturing of by-products. The management of sugar factories in the co-operative sector is carried out by the Board of Directors in democratic manner. The Government also provides capital to the sugar factories in form of share capital. Industrial Economic Development Corporation provides long term loan up to 60% of the expenditure. Central and state government undertakes 50% guarantee for loan. Majority of the sugar factories are in Maharashtra.',
    
    'Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Kashmir on March 7 for the first time since his government revoked Article 370 in 2019 two weeks after his visit to Jammu, where he announced a slew of development projects, distributed letters of appointment to 1,500 new government recruits, opened an IIT campus and inaugurated the erstwhile State first electric train. In Srinagar, he is to address a public meeting, and considering that elections are to be held soon, he is certain to make more announcements. But as far as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is concerned, two moves by the government in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) one last month, and another in 2022 have already paved the way for what it hopes will be its first ever Lok Sabha seat in the Kashmir Valley. That seat is Anantnag constituency in south Kashmir. On February 6, the Lok Sabha passed the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes Order (Amendment) Bill, 2024. It was passed in the Rajya Sabha three days later. An amendment and a community protests the amendment expands the list of the State Scheduled Tribes (ST) to add four groups to the existing 12 Pahari, Gadda Brahmin, Koli and Paddari. Of the other groups in the category, first drawn up in J&K in 1991, the Muslim community of Gujjar-Bakerwal were the most dominant. Their protests that Paharis cannot be considered a tribe, but are a linguistic category encompassing several Hindu and Muslim castes, and include forward upper castes, Other Backward Classes and Scheduled Castes (SC), were to no avail. The Gujjars argued that Paharis were socially, economically and educationally advanced, and well represented politically. They were also beneficiaries under three separate existing quotas in government employment and education for people living near the Line of Control (LoC), for people living in backward and remote areas, and a 4% quota in government jobs, carved out specifically for Paharis in 2020. The Paharis had since 1989 sought to be categorised as ST but the demand was rejected several times, including in 2014, when the Omar Abdullah government recommended it. But the BJP warmed up to its potential, and immediately after the revocation of Article 370 in 2019, began the prep work for it. The jobs quota for Paharis was announced within six months. In 2020, it also set up the Jammu & Kashmir Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Commission, which was headed by a retired judge, Justice G.D. Sharma.',
    
    'Nidhal is a village in the drought prone region of Khatav taluka in Satara district. The geographical area of the village is 2001 hectares and the population is between 5000. Tankers had to supply drinking water to the village till the implementation of the watershed development project. Under the leadership of Chartered Officer Shri. Chandrakant Dalvi, the overall development of the village has been done since 1983 on the strength of public participation. With the help of NABARD, the Indo-German Water development Project was implemented on the entire 2001 hectare of the village from 2006 to 2011. Due to completion of all these works for agricultural treatment and drainage line treatment, the entire water (every drop of water) of the village has been blocked by various treatments under the watershed development. Public participation is a key feature of this watershed development. The total cost of the project in 2006 was Rs 1.46 crore. As many as 20% of its people participation has been reported. As per NABARD rules, 17% people participation were expected while the village has given 20% people participation. In this, each account holder farmer has contributed 20% of the expenditure incurred on his land. Those who could not afford the labour (shramadan) contributed the same amount to the Watershed Development Committee. While implementing this watershed development project, the five principles of grazing ban, axe ban, sterilization, drug ban and shramadan have been implemented. Their strict implementation has been done due to public participation. The following are the major features of Nidhal village watershed development and water conservation project. This project has been implemented by the Nidhal Watershed Development Committee of the village. This is the first watershed development project in the country implemented by a village watershed committee without an NGO. This is the greatest example of public participation. Soil and water conservation treatments were carried out according to the formula from top to bottom. To the north of the village is a steep hill. The top of the hill and the steep slope are covered with plantation by doing stone bunding and contour bunding. It is the first watershed project in the country to be implemented on a steep hillside. There are four streams in the area of Nidhal village and a series of cement dams are being built on them. The last embankment near the outlet of the watershed and the upper embankment at the end of its backwaters were constructed, using this formula 70 cement embankments were constructed in all the four streams. Out of this, 33% public participation has been given by the beneficiary farmers in the cement dam constructed under NABARD. The combined length of all the four streams is 28 km and when all the dams fill due to rain, a water column of 28 km length is erected on the outskirts of Nidhal village. Some dams store water till the end of April.',
    
    'One of the cardinal principles of a functioning and modern democracy is that only the state, led by a government that is elected by the people, has a legitimate right to use or to authorise the use of physical force. When civilian groups resort to violence against state actors without repercussions, one has to call into question the maintenance of law and order in the State of Manipur. In late February, cadres of the Meitei chauvinist group, the Arambai Tenggol, allegedly abducted a police officer, assaulted him and vandalised his home. Police officers protested the attack, lamenting their inability to take action against the group. It is another matter that the group has managed to source its weapons from the looting of police stations in the valley following the ethnic configuration last May. Many of the weapons are yet to be seized or returned despite the government appeals. The police in the valley are heavily ethicized with barely any representation from the Kuki-Zo minority. Yet, the impunity with which the Arambai Tenggol has acted against a police official, and even assaulted a leader of the opposition in the recent past besides administering oath to legislators from the valley to pledge for its majoritarian cause, suggest that such actions have either the nod of the leadership of the State government or have been deliberately ignored. The severe ethnicisation in the valley and the hills has also granted a degree of popularity to groups such as the Arambai Tenggol and counterparts in the hills, making law enforcement difficult to achieve. It is now incumbent upon the Union government and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to take into account the severity of the ethnic polarisation and the dangers posed to law and order. Humanitarian concerns related to the displacement of people apart, the predominance of extra-legal forces in public life in the valley and the hills points to the de legitimisation of the idea of the state alone having a monopoly over the use of physical force in establishing law and order. The rampant radicalisation provides an opportunity for the muzzled civic voices in Manipur, and in the valley in particular, to raise their concerns about the impunity enjoyed by such forces. Unless the Chief Minister, N. Biren Singh, cracks the whip on the Arambai Tenggol, the radicalisation of Manipuri society will continue, making a return to a much-needed civic state of affairs all the more difficult. But with Mr. Singh acting less as a Chief Minister and more as a leader promoting majoritarian politics, it is incumbent upon the BJP leadership to yet again rethink its strategy to let the status quo continue in the State.',
    
    'One morning in a small apartment in Bombay a girl of about sixteen looked up from the newspaper and said excitedly, Pandit Ravi Shankar is playing tomorrow at the Shanmukhananda auditorium. Said her mother pointing to the figure sleeping on the bed. You will wake him up. You know he needs all the sleep and rest he can get. But the boy on the bed was not asleep. Pandit Ravi Shankar! He said. Pandit Ravi Shankar, the sitar maestro? He raised himself up on his elbows for one second, and then fell back. But his eyes were shining. We must not miss the chance, he said. I have always wanted to hear him and see him. Lie down son, lie down. His mother sprang to his side. He actually raised himself up without help, she murmured with a catch in her throat and her eyes turned to the idols on a corner shelf. The prayer, which she uttered endlessly, came unbidden to her lips. I must hear him and see him, the boy repeated. It is the chance of a lifetime. Then he began to cough and gasp for breath and had to be given oxygen from the cylinder that stood under the bed. But his large eyes were fixed on his sister. Smita bit her lip in self-reproach. She had been so excited at seeing the announcement, that she had not remembered that her brother was very ill. She had seen how the doctors had shaken their heads gravely and spoken words that neither she nor even her parents could understand. But somewhere deep inside Smita had known the frightening truth that Anant was going to die. The word cancer had hung in the air her brother was dying of cancer even though she pretended that all would be well and they would return together, a small family of four, to their home in Gaganpur. And he was only fifteen and the best table-tennis player in the school and the fastest runner. He was learning to play the sitar: they were both taking sitar lessons, but Anant was better than her as in many other things. He was already able to compose his own tunes to the astonishment of their guru. Then cancer had struck and they had come to Bombay so that he could be treated at the cancer hospital in the city. Whenever they came to Bombay they stayed with Aunt Sushila. Her apartment was not big but there was always room for them. They had come with high hopes in the miracles of modern science. They told themselves that Anant would be cured at the hospital and he would again walk and run and even take part in the forthcoming table-tennis tournament. And, he would play the sitar perhaps be a great sitarist one day.',
    
    'Technology is often developed from the basic knowledge of science combined with engineering. For example, science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already existing tools and knowledge. This new found knowledge may then be used by engineers to manufacture new tools and machines such as semiconductors, computers, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered as technologists. Therefore the three fields i.e. Science, Technology and Engineering are often considered as one for the purposes of research and development. Science is the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world. Technology is the application of practical sciences for Industry or Commerce. Technology refers to methods, systems, and devices which are the result of scientific knowledge being used for practical purposes. A modern example is the rise of Information Technology (IT) which is the combined application of Computer Science and Electronics. Engineering is the application of mathematics, as well as scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge. This helps to invent, innovate, design, and manufacture, materials, components, tools, machines, weapon systems etc. Looking back into ancient and medieval history, India gave the world great knowledge in Astronomy, Mathematics, and Textiles and in many other fields. Until the 17th century India was economically and militarily at par with the European nations. In 1780 Tipu Sultan surprised the British forces in battle by using rockets against them; the British copied these rockets and used them against Napoleon in Europe in 1812. The industrial revolution in Europe in the 18th century rapidly changed the industrial capacity of Europe and it progressed rapidly. However, due to the British rule such an industrial revolution did not take place in India. India has taken major strides in science and technology since its independence and today it is recognized for its achievements in many fields. These include Agriculture, Textiles, Health-care and Pharmaceuticals, Information-Technology, Space Technology, Defence Technologies and Nuclear Technology. Several initiatives have been taken in the field of Science and Technology by the Indian government to enhance the security of the Nation. Some of these initiatives were for civilian use while some had defence applications. It is necessary to understand that it is not possible to say that certain technology is only for civilian use or for defence use. For example, satellites are used for regular mobile phone communication; they are also used by Defence Forces for their communication. Similarly, Nuclear Science is used for production of electricity; it is also used for production of nuclear weapons.',
    
    'That there is wide global consensus on the need The boundary wall enclosing discussions around global climate is 1.5 Degrees Celsius, or the average increase in global temperatures since pre-industrial times. Now that 1 Degrees Celsius is crossed, all the wrangling under way at the climate summit in Dubai is to cap the half degree rise. Global pledges to cut emissions are insufficient to achieve this. Current estimates are that to limit warming to 1.5 Degrees Celsius, the world requires three times more renewable energy capacity by 2030, or at least 11,000 GW for this tripling was first formally articulated in the New Delhi Leaders Declaration at the G-20 summit in Delhi in September. In the run up to the Dubai summit, it was perceived that this would be widely endorsed by the larger group of about 190 countries signatory to the UN convention on climate. It turns out that, so far, 118 countries have endorsed the pledge and two major countries, i.e., India and China, have so far abstained from signing. The Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge, while still a draft text, says that in their pursuit of tripling renewable energy capacity, signatories should also commit to phase down of unabated coal power, in particular ending the continued investment in unabated new coal fired power plants. This is a major red line for India.  While India has positioned itself as a champion for renewable energy its 2030 targets as articulated in its formal, nationally determined contributions (NDC) speak of tripling renewable energy capacity to 500 GW from the current 170 GW it has reiterated several times that it could not be forced to give up certain fuels. Coal fired plants are responsible for nearly 70% of India    greenhouse gas emissions. Developed countries that have made commitments to give up coal often have other large, fossil-fuel resources as backup. The United States joined 56 other countries at Dubai in a commitment to completely eschew coal for its energy use, by 2035. However the U.S. only draws about 20% of its energy from coal and at least 55% from oil and gas, with plans to actually produce more of it in 2030 than at present. The paradox of the world’s major economies commitment to renewable energy is that it is not, as of now, actively geared to replace fossil fuel. Till there is an honest commitment to actually replace existing and future fossil capacity with clean energy, pledges and declarations are worth little more than the paper they are drafted on.',
    
    'Michael Faraday is regarded as one of the most distinguished scientists and inventors of modern times, and his work on electricity is still a subject of study, in the form of Faradays Laws. But few know his inspirational life story, which is all about courage and fighting against the odds. Michael Faraday was born into a poverty stricken family in a dirty London suburb. He suffered from a speech defect as a child. He would pronounce rabbit as wabbit. He could not even say his own name and would call himself Fawaday. Other children laughed at him and teachers did not help him either. When he was twelve, his mother was forced to take him out of school, thus putting an end to his formal education. At thirteen, however, he started working with a bookbinder, binding hundreds of book during the day and staying up all night to read them. Reading thus became his obsession. One day he came across a book on electricity which had been sent to his master for binding. He started reading it and was completely hooked. That was his first introduction to the subject of electricity, which soon became a lifelong fascination. Faraday was still poor at twenty-one. Once, a friend gave him a free ticket to a public lecture and demonstration by the renowned chemist Humphry Davy at Londons Royal Institution. Davys work on chemicals and electrical lighting was the subject of conversation among the scientists Think and answer why do you think Faradays friend give him a free ticket to Davy programme?  Before you read further, guess what the passage is about. Listen, read and answer what were the odds against Faraday in his childhood? What is meaning of Reading became his obsession Electricity became a lifelong fascination. Great scientists are persevering and never deterred by difficulties. 50 of that age, Seventy years later, across the Atlantic Ocean in the USA, the same work enabled Thomas Edison to produce the first consistent light bulb. That day in 1812 Faraday was spellbound by Davy lecture. He kept taking notes about the mysterious force of electric fluid. He was so engrossed in the lecture that he forgot to applaud with the rest of the crowd. When he went back, his notes were so comprehensive that he bound them into a book, meaning to gift it to Davy someday. Faraday decided that day that he did not just want to sell books, he wanted to be a great scientist good enough to write his own books. Davy became his role model. But there was a problem. He did not have the social status, money or the education to pursue science. Faraday thought it would be wonderful if Davy became his mentor, but Davy did not agree initially. Faraday was not dejected; he just kept trying. Destiny had a strange plan in store for him.',
    
    'A tsunami is a very large and powerful wave caused by earthquakes under the sea. On 26 December 2004, a tsunami hit Thailand and parts of India such as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and the Tamil Nadu coast. Here are some stories of courage and survival. Did animals sense that a tsunami was coming? Some stories suggest that they did. These stories are all from the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. Ignesious was the manager of a cooperative society in Katchall. His wife woke him up at 6 a.m. because she felt an earthquake. Ignesious carefully took his television set off its table and put it down on the ground so that it would not fall and break. Then the family rushed out of the house. When the tremors stopped, they saw the sea rising. In the chaos and confusion, two of his children caught hold of the hands of their mother father and mothers brother, and rushed in the opposite direction. He never saw them again. His wife was also swept away. Only the three other children who came with him were saved. Sanjeev was a policeman, serving in the Katchall Island of the Nicobar group of islands. He somehow managed to save himself, his wife and his baby daughter from the waves. But then he heard cries for help from the wife of John, the guesthouse cook. Sanjeev jumped into the water to rescue her, but they were both swept away. Thirteen year old Meghna was swept away along with her parents and seventy seven other people. She spent two days floating in the sea, holding on to a wooden door. Eleven times she saw relief helicopters overhead, but they did not see her. She was brought to the shore by a wave, and was found walking on the seashore in a daze. Almas Javed was ten years old. She was a student of Carmel Convent in Port Blair where her father had a petrol pump. Her mother Rahila home was in Nancowry Island. The family had gone there to celebrate when the tremors came early in the morning, the family was sleeping. Almas father saw the sea water recede. He understood that the water would come rushing back with great force. He woke everyone up and tried to rush them to a safer place. As they ran, her grandfather was hit on the head by something and he fell down. Her father rushed to help him. Then came the first giant wave that swept both of them away. Almas mother and aunts stood clinging to the leaves of a coconut tree, calling out to her. A wave uprooted the tree, and they too were washed away. Almas saw a log of wood floating. She climbed on to it. Then she fainted. When she woke up, she was in a hospital in Kamorta. From there she was brought to Port Blair. The little girl does not want to talk about the incident with anyone. She is still traumatised.',
    
    'The freedom of workers to withdraw their labour is essential in any democratic society, but it does not automatically trump all other rights. The Minimum Service Levels Act, brought into force last month by the government, was a statute designed to recognise this important trade off balancing the right of unions to organise strike action against the countervailing right of the general public to go about their lives unimpeded. The law allows employers in a limited number of vital sectors including fire services, nuclear decommissioning, health and transport to compel trade unions to keep services operating at a basic level, with trade unions required to take reasonable steps to ensure their members comply. When it comes to Britain railway network, the decision to invoke these new legal powers is at the discretion of rail operators. However, of the sixteen companies whose services are being brought to a halt during the renewed wave of strike action by the drivers union Aslef, not a single one has chosen to take advantage of the new law. Had they done so, Aslef would have had to operate 40 percent of all timetabled services. Instead, the operators timid inaction means that rolling strikes will paralyse Britain railways until February 6. It is long past time that railway operators behaved with greater resolve in the face of intransigent industrial tactics. The only rail company even to contemplate applying the new law London North Eastern Railway (LNER), which is entirely state owned immediately backed down when Aslef responded by threatening an additional five days of walkouts. LNER and its fellow operators should have had the gumption to stand firm. Their primary responsibility is not to pander to the narrow sectional interests of trade unions, but to ensure that their passengers retain some degree of access to a vital service. Next time, they must discharge this responsibility with greater determination and seek damages from unions in the event that they disobey the law. In defending Aslef position, Mick Whelan, the union general secretary, has argued that minimum service requirements threaten to infringe on the ability of workers to carry out their roles safely, and that they make strikes a natural by-product. In reality, it is far from clear why provision of a workforce sufficient to operate a basic service need compromise the safety of either passengers or staff. To suggest it does is disingenuous scaremongering. More galling, however, is the dismissive manner in which Mr Whelan seeks to obstruct the use of a piece of legislation for which the government secured a clear democratic mandate as part of its manifesto in 2019.',
    
    'We have been introduced to various subjects at school so far but we have not yet been taught Philosophy. Nevertheless the word has often fallen on our ears. We criticize a person for sounding philosophical when he/she addresses a topic in a grave, elaborate manner. I have a different philosophy of life. Keep yours to yourself, one says. These remarks shape our notions, opinions on Philosophy. On such a basis we determine its value and whether it is worth being pursued. But one must be well acquainted with a subject before judging its significance and usefulness, do not you think? In this chapter we shall acquaint ourselves a little with Philosophy Humans have felt a deep sense of wonder about the world around them for more than thousands of years, long before the contemporary branches of knowledge were founded. Human beings are involved in a constant struggle to know. In fact, every living being must acquire some knowledge of itself and its surroundings in order to survive. Man learnt a great many things while striving to survive but his curiosity about the universe peculiarly surpassed the extent that was required to fulfil their basic needs. Why do nightly stars disappear in daytime? Why do some beings walk, while some others crawl or fly? What does it mean to die? Questions, questions, more questions! Humans continued to be perplexed by countless questions as they undertook the quest for answers. The prehistoric human was no different than a baby that has just learnt to utter its first fumbling words. His/her mind was brimming with such excited curiosity as can be seen in the gleaming eyes of a toddler.Thus emerged the enquiries about living and non-living beings what is this? Why is it so? Why does it change? The development of intellectual, rational, linguistic abilities of human beings furthered with time. The traditional purpose of philosophy has been to attain a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. One must study it properly and consider various aspects of it. One must maintain a critical approach in the course of this study. Philosophy has used unique methods to attain this goal. Philosophy neither relies on faith, nor lets imagination run wild nor uses the empirical methods used by science as we saw. Intellect, especially the faculty of reason is the chief device employed by philosophy. Methods of philosophy guide us on the efficient use of this device.',
    
    'Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, the father of India integrated guided missile program, states three visions for India based on the achievements and progress that he has witnessed in the history of the nation and during his own career, as a missile scientist. Dr Kalam three visions for India are FREEDOM, DEVELOPMENT, and STANDING UP. The focus of his presentation is on developing India to its fullest potential, while standing up to the rest of the world with fully validated self-respect for the achievements that have been obtained in the modern times. If we are not free, no one will respect us. I have three visions for India. In 3,000 years of our history, people from all over the world have come and invaded us, captured our land and conquered our minds. From Alexander onwards the Greeks, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch all of them came and looted us and took over what was ours. Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture and their history, nor tried to force our way of life on them. Why because we respect the freedom of others. That is why my first vision for India is FREEDOM. I believe that India had its first vision of freedom in 1857, when we started the War of independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us. My second vision for India is DEVELOPMENT. For 50 years, we have been a developing nation. It is time to see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among the top five nations of the world in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP); we have 10 per cent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling and our achievements are being globally recognized today. Yet we lack the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation Three Visions for India vision a dream, an ideal validated  confirmed with proof potential capacity, ability standing up to being brave and facing challenges took over took the authority of nurture develop 41 self-reliant self-dependant What are the characteristics of a developed nation? Self-driving controlling oneself what are the drawbacks of us Indians? Remote sensing satellites manmade satellites launched into space for communication, weather forecast etc. self-sustaining providing for one needs gory involving bloodshed and violence self-reliant and self- assured. Is not this right? India must stand up to the world I have a third vision, that India must STAND UP to the world or no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. We must be strong not only as a military power, but also as an economic power both must go hand-in-hand.',
    
    'Linen yarn is made from fibers removed from the stem of a slender flax plant. Since it is obtained from the stem of the plant it is termed as Bast fibers. These fibers, held together under the stem bark by a gummy substance, pectin, which forms the body of the flax plant. The word flax is derived the old English Fleax. Linen is term applied to the yarn spun from the flax fibers and to the cloth or fabric woven from this yarn. The flax fiber is basically composed of the woody substance, cellulose. Linen is considered to be the oldest fiber used in the Western World, which dates back to about 10,000 BC. There are references in the Bible regarding the use of Linen. It was used in Egypt from 3000 to 2500 B.C. These early fabrics were very fine and delicate and were considered the fabric of luxury. This was fashionable and regal fabric of middle Ages. From Egypt, it was introduced in Great Britain around 1000 B.C. When cotton gin was developed, linen lost much of its importance. Flax of various grades is mainly produced in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Ireland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Italy and U.S.S.R. The flax plant requires a temperate climate with cloudy skies and adequate moisture. It grows well in deep, rich, well plowed soil. To obtain best quality of fibers the crop should be carefully rotated. Crop rotation program of five years yields good harvest. Flax seed is planted by hand in April or May. The seeds are sown close together, so that the plant will grow dense but fine. The flax plant reaches a height of 2-4 feet. Its blossoms are delicate pale blue, white or pink. Plants are pulled before the seeds are ripe when it is to be used for fibers. By the end of August flax turns brownish in colour. It indicates that it is ready for pulling. At this stage if it is delayed, the fibers loose its prized luster and soft texture. Flax for fibers is pulled by hand or mechanical pullers, to keep the roots and stalk intact for the fibers extend below ground surface. The stalks are tied in bundles called beets. After drying the plants, the seeds and leaves are removed from the stem of the flax plant by passing the stalks through coarse combs. This process is called rippling. Bundles of flax are then piled in the fields to dry. To obtain the fibers from the stalk, the outer woody portion must be removed. The bundles of plant are then steeped in water. This allows the tissue or woody bark surrounding the fiber to decompose and loosen the gum that binds the fiber to the stem. This decomposing and fermentation is called retting.',
    
    'The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 30 of the 56 Rajya Sabha seats which are set to fall vacant in April, from 15 States, with the results announced on February 27. The party won two more seats than what its numbers in the State Assemblies would have allowed, by brazenly engineering cross voting by legislators from the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh and the Congress in Himachal Pradesh. One BJP MLA in Karnataka crossed over to the Congress side. With six MLAs lost to the BJP, who have since been disqualified by the Speaker of the Assembly, the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh is tottering on the edge. Abhishek Manu Singhvi of the Congress and Harsh Mahajan of the BJP got 34 votes each and Mr. Mahajan was declared winner through lots. The Rajya Sabha polls brought the disenchantment within the Congress with Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu out to the fore. Vikramaditya Singh, a rebel Minister, announced his resignation, only to retract his statement. The Congress is making efforts to save its government, but the crisis is far from over. In Uttar Pradesh, seven Samajwadi Party legislators voted for the BJP, leading to the party winning an additional seat. It is not the first time that the BJP has shed in troubled waters to gain an extra berth in the Rajya Sabha. In 2017, Congress strategist Ahmed Patel managed to win by a whisker in Gujarat; and in 2020, the rebellion against the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan happened on the eve of elections to the Upper House. The BJP now has 97 members in the Upper House, and, along with the allies, is just four short of the majority mark of 121 in the Rajya Sabha, where the current strength is 240. While successive victories in the State elections have helped the BJP improve its position, growing from 78 members in 2019 to 97 at the end of the years, the party has never shied away from pushing the boundaries of normative politics to increase its strength. The gap between the BJP, the single largest party in the Rajya Sabha, and the Congress, which has just 29 members, is far too wide to be bridged any time soon. The other Opposition parties too have only a limited presence with the Trinamool Congress at 13, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Aam Aadmi Party with 10 each, the Rashtriya Janata Dal with six and the Communist Party of India. In past parliamentary sessions, the Opposition members were frequently suspended whenever they sought to question the government, making Parliament a theatre of the government unilateralism.',
    
    'As a journalist covering Maharashtra, I often travel across the State. These assignments involve more than just researching and packing a bag. The first step is to contact the local police, activists, academics, and journalists from other organisations. Speaking to various people provides reporters with context to the issue being covered, different perspectives, and, critically, nuance. In this process, I have encountered many people who I consider the silent architects behind the most compelling stories. They are regional journalists. I try to meet many of them in person, but most of our interactions have largely been over the phone. These journalists have an indepth understanding of the local landscape and have connections in every nook and corner. They remain behind the scenes and rarely seek recognition. They occur invaluable guidance and insights and do not expect to be quoted or mentioned in the journal piece. They help simply because they share the reporter goal of shining a torch on truths that might otherwise remain obscured. Recently, I interacted with Bhagwat Taware, a regional journalist from Beed, and Kailash Tawar, an insurance agent and farmer from Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where I went to report on farmer suicides. They had taken time of their routine work to help me comprehend the issue and engage with more people. They travelled with me in their respective districts. It is not just reporters from the metros and from English language publications who seek their assistance; foreign journalists rely heavily on them too. They are the sources we cannot do without. They even take pride in seeing their contributions acknowledged indirectly when the journalists who report the story that they helped unearth receive awards. Beyond their role as information providers, these people also extend hospitality. They treat us as guests. Recognition is not what I am seeking. What important to us is that you have travelled all the way from Mumbai to shed light on the struggles that the people here face. Your report will be read by people in Delhi who will know that their government here obscures data, Mr. Taware explained to me on our way to a village. At times, I feel that they take my reporting more seriously than even I do. During our interactions with the families of farmers who had passed away in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Mr. Tawar, having grasped my interviewing style, initiated the conversation himself and prepared the interviewees for the camera. He even asked me to interview one farmer family, which was not scheduled.',
    
    'Poverty is one of the major challenges faced by Indian economy. It is a socio- economic phenomenon. Poverty is perceived as social exclusion of a certain section of people in the society. Deprivation of basic needs and denial of opportunities has led to social exclusion. Poverty in India has a long history. Economic drain of resources, decline of handicraft and cottage industries, oppressive economic policies, recurrence of famines etc. were responsible for mass poverty among the people during the British period. Elimination of poverty has been the top agenda of the Indian Government since Independence. Policy measures such as economic planning, economic reforms and antipoverty programmes such as garibi hatao have helped in greater reduction of poverty. In the conventional sense, poverty refers to a situation in which a major section of the people in the society are unable to fulfil even the basic needs of life such as food, clothing and shelter due to lack of sufficient income. Concept of poverty in the conventional sense was limited only to basic needs of life. However, in modern times, the scope of the concept of poverty has been enlarged. Of late, the concept of multi-dimensional poverty has emerged. Multi-dimensional poverty refers to deprivation in terms of both material and non-material dimensions. Material dimensions relate to deprivation in terms of food, clothing, shelter, health, education, road connectivity, electricity, access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities etc. The non-material dimensions are associated with social discrimination. Absolute poverty is measured in terms of minimum calorie intake. Earlier, Planning Commission determined per capita daily calorie requirement of 2400 calories for a person living in the rural area and 2100 calories for a person living in the urban area. On an average, the per capita daily calorie requirement amounts to 2250 calories. Absence of minimum income to satisfy the desired level of calorie intake of food leads to absolute poverty. It is mostly found in the developing countries like India. Absolute poverty can be eradicated through effective poverty alleviation measures. It is difficult to define the concept of relative poverty. It is judged on the basis of comparison of relative standards of living of different sections of the people. Relative poverty is measured with respect to differences in the levels of income, wealth, consumption, economic inactivity (unemployment, old age) etc. Such poverty is found in all the countries of the world. It is an universal phenomenon. Relative poverty cannot be completely eradicated. However, it can be reduced to some extent through appropriate policy measures.',
    
    'The Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Secretariat has, at last, declared the Tirukkoyilur Assembly constituency as vacant following the conviction and disqualification of former Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudy in a disproportionate assets case in December last. The delay is in stark contrast to the way Vilavancode was declared vacant in February here, the legislator concerned quit after changing her party aviation. But, it is inexplicable why there was so much of a time lag for Tirukkoyilur even though the Madras High Court order of conviction was not stayed by the Supreme Court, which had only exempted Mr. Ponmudy and his wife from surrendering despite the High Court sentence of three year simple imprisonment. The AIADMK General Secretary, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, had written to the Assembly Speaker, M. Appavu, urging him to act without bias in declaring the seat vacant. Mr. Ponmud disqualification fell under Section 8(1) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and not Section 8(3) under which Member of Parliament Rahul Gandhi was disqualified after his conviction (now stayed by the Supreme Court) and two year sentence in a criminal defamation case. Section 8(1) lists out offences covered under laws such as the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, and Prevention of Corruption Act and states that a conviction and mere imposition of a under those laws would be sufficient for a legislator disqualification. The delay in the declaration of the vacancy becomes curious as jurists highlight that Section 8(1) uses the phrase shall be disqualified. This means that the disqualification notification must necessarily take effect from the day when a legislator is convicted. In this case, it should have happened on December 19, 2023, when the High Court held Mr. Ponmudy guilty. When the judiciary displays renewed interest in pursuing anti-corruption cases, especially those concerning lawmakers, it would do well for the legislature to act in tandem. Otherwise, there would be no purpose in having a system of special courts for cases involving MP/MLAs or an arrangement in the High Court to look after such cases, particularly after conviction is awarded. At a time when liberal democracy is facing serious challenges in India, the legislature supporting the judiciary in stamping out corruption in public life would instil confidence. At the same time, the judiciary and legislature should not be seen as failing to protect critics of the establishment. After all, democracy is about tolerating dissent and respecting it too. It is incumbent upon all to play by the rules of the game in a fair manner to avoid any impression that authoritarianism of the executive or tyranny of the majority in the legislature or judicial overreach is becoming the norm.',
    
    'Under the SAMRUDDHI Mission, efforts are being made through the National Rural development society in Panchayat. Special efforts are being done by Padamashree Popatrao Pawar and various administrative officer in the rich panchayat like Hiware Bazar. Watershed development began in 1995 in Hiware Bazar. Gram Sabha called and approved the work of watershed area development and rural development. After the start of work, all the works were completed according to the plan that has been planned in the three years. In those works (The water flowing down from the hillside) parallel trenches dug into the ground, and seeps into the ground, dams were built in the streams of water to block the flow of water, diversion of this water into a seepage pond or divert into a pond after completing all the works significant levels of water in the village wells increased. As a result, enough water became available for farmers in the village for conservation irrigation during the kharif season. As well as some of the area under cultivation in the village started getting benefits of irrigation for Rabi season crops. In Hiware Bazar village, due to watershed development work about 400 mm of rain water falling every drop began to come in utilization. There were 97 wells before water conservation and soil conservation work was done. But the water level in it had gone deeper than 100 ft. After completion of water conservation and soil conservation work groundwater level increased and it was possible to dig 132 new wells for irrigation to farmers. There are total 229 wells in village. In these wells the water level increased up to 50 ft. Electric pump are setup on all wells to draw the water. Because of these changes protective irrigation facility has become available to all cultivated areas in the village cultivation. During kharif season it was possible to sow in all the land. During the Rabi season, about 220 hectares of low water irrigatied husk (Bhusar) crops can be grown. Thus the density of the crops is 128. Agricultural productivity, per hectare production has almost double in the past. Hiware Bazar village has decided cultivation-structure of the village considering the availability of available natural resources. The Gram Sabha passed a resolution to ban the digging of new bore wells in the village. It was mandatory to use water from bore well water reserve for domestic use only. That decision of the Gram Sabha provides pure drinking water to people. Since the water from bore wells is reserved for domestic use only, the groundwater uptake is less than the amount that is filled in every year. This process has led to a continuous rise in groundwater levels. The Government schemes are welfare when coordinating and agreeing leadership and public participation and every panchayat in the country is ideal and if we work with social spirit, every panchayat in the country will become ideal, this was realized while working in this village.',
    
    'It was a judgment that has rankled for years. The artificial distinction that the Supreme Court of India made over 25 years ago between bribe-givers and bribe-takers in the infamous JMM bribery case left many aghast that those who paid crores of rupees to MPs for voting in favour of the P.V. Narasimha Rao government in a no-confidence motion were to be prosecuted for corruption, but those who took the money were immune from prosecution. The reason was that those who had voted for money enjoyed the constitutional privilege of not being subject to any legal consequence for anything said or any vote given in Parliament. There was one exception among the alleged bribe-takers Ajit Singh, who was accused of taking a payoff, was to be prosecuted because he was absent during the voting, and was thus stripped of the protection enjoyed by those who actually voted in terms of the bribery agreement. The Court has corrected this anomaly in the law related to parliamentary privileges by holding that there can be no immunity for a Member of Parliament or a State legislature against a bribery charge in connection with a vote or speech in the legislature. In overruling the majority verdict in P.V. Narasimha Rao vs State (CBI/SPE) (1998), a seven-member Constitution Bench has foregrounded probity as the main aspect of parliamentary functioning. The Court has made it clear that parliamentary privilege, enshrined in Article 105 (for MPs) and Article 194 (for State legislators) is aimed at protecting the freedom of speech and independence of the legislators in their functioning in the House and cannot extend to bribery, as it is not essential to the casting of the vote or in deciding how to cast it. A key rationale that weighed with the Constitution Bench in 1998 was that parliamentary privilege was essential to protecting members from persecution for anything said or any vote in the House. The majority feared that limiting this privilege might have serious consequences and felt that public indignation over the conduct of some MPs accepting a bribe should not lead to the court construing the Constitution so narrowly that it removes the guarantee for effective parliamentary participation and debate. However, the seven members Bench has concluded that the potential for such misuse is neither enhanced nor diminished by recognising the court jurisdiction to prosecute a member for bribery. The Bench has also held that voting in a Rajya Sabha election, being part of a legislator function, is protected under Article 194 of the Constitution as a privilege. It requires utmost protection for a member to vote freely and without fear of legal persecution. Overall, the verdict meets public expectation that the members they elect do not act under monetary inducement.',
    
    'Maharashtra Government has established five development board for completion of irrigation project. In this Krishna valley development board, Vidharbha irrigation development board, Tapi irrigation development board, Marathwada irrigation development board, Kokan irrigation development board are involved. In the early days after the establishment, these corporations were allowed to raise funds from the open market. Consolidated funds are raised from Maharashtra irrigation finance board for all corporation recently. Projects which do not come under the corporation come under the water resources department. The Government has taken concrete steps to strengthen the irrigation capacity of the state by restructuring all the existing irrigation development corporation into the river development agency making changes in the planning and management of river basins. Geographically the state was divided into five river basins. In this, Krishna, Godawari, Tapi, Narmada and rivers from Kokan area west channel are involved. These five river basins have been further subdivided into 25 sub basins for proper planning. In three years of 1996 to 1998 approved basins wise 5 corporation 5 laws in Maharashtra Corporation. There are 71 articles of laws which have same structure and function of corporation. However, on some important issues, the difference can be stated as follows. For example, Godavari water crisis is mentioned in Vidharbha corporation laws, but it is not mentioned in Godavari Corporation. All areas of west Maharashtra and Krishna basins of Marathwada have been announced as work field. The Vidarbha and Konkan corporation has been given only certain projects without giving all the areas in that division. Dhule and Jalgaon districts part of Tapi basin is given to Tapi irrigation Development Corporation. All areas of Godavari basin Nashik and Nagar of Marathwada is given to Godavari corporation. Therefore, Soygaon Taluka and other talukas of Aurangabad district are involved in Tapi basins. It is not in the territory of any corporation. In order to make the role of the government more tangible by involvement of the farmers in irrigation management to operate and manage the irrigation project by the people after the completion of the project is the basic definition of democracy. Following the same principle, law was enacled which gave equal justice to all the beneficiaries and gave the right to the weaker farmers to look after the irrigation development of Maharashtra and it means Maharashtra farmers irrigation management act 2005. Maharashtra Government has passed an act for water use institutions. Therefore, water will not be provided individually for farmers by water resources department, water will be provided to only water use institutes in cube measurement method and the government will be remain only the mediator between water use institutes and farmers.',
    
    'Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That is it. Just three stories. The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months before I really quit. Looking back, it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I could stop taking the required classes that did not interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting. I did not have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends rooms. I returned Coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Here one example Reed College offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Because I had to take a calligraphy class, I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about what makes great typography great. Ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. If I had never dropped in on that course in college the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or for that matter even proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied Mac, it is likely no personal computer would have them. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very clear looking backwards 10 years later. You cannot connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in some things your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. My second story is about love and loss. I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz (Steve Wozniak) and I started Apple when I was 20. In 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company. And then I got fired. It was devastating. But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did. And so I decided to start over. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.',
    
    'There is uncertainty in every Presidential race, but an extraordinary number of questions about Donald Trump candidacy are ending up at the Supreme Court. For example, any reckoning of the odds that he will come out of the month of March as the presumptive Republican nominee has to factor in both his dominance in the primaries and the outcome of Trump v. Anderson, the case about whether he is disqualified from holding office again, under the Fourteenth Amendment, because of his involvement in the events of January 6th. In April, there will be oral arguments in at least two more Supreme Court cases Joseph Fischer v. United States, on the sixteenth, and Trump v. United States, during the week of the twenty-second, which the Court agreed to take last Wednesday. Each has the potential to do a great deal of damage to one or more of the four criminal cases that Trump is facing. Legal Scholars are extremely thankful for the Supreme Court Decision to hear the latest case, Trump posted on Truth Social. He surely is. Trump v. United States is the better known of the two April cases; indeed, it is notorious, because of how extreme Trump claims are. He is arguing that former Presidents are immune from criminal prosecution for any allegedly official acts that took place during their terms, unless they are impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate first. Trump was impeached but acquitted, a fact that he spun into a far-fetched com plaint about double jeopardy, which the Court, to its credit, did not take up. (The Court also indicated that it would not address the question of whether his acts really were official.) Trump has said that Presidents should have absolute immunity even if they do things that cross the line. The Supreme Court has not previously been very clear about where the line lies which could be one reason that it took the case. Presidents are generally protected from criminal charges while in the White House, and ex-Presidents are immune from suits for civil damages for official acts. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit drew an admirably firm line in turning Trump down flat. It may be one of many tragedies for the country that the boundaries will now be worked out in the midst of an election campaign, by a Court with a conservative super-majority Trump attempts to claim immunity in lower courts have already delayed by more than two months his trial in the District of Columbia on charges, brought by the special counsel Jack Smith, related to January 6th. The earliest trial date now, even if the Court rules quickly, might be in late July or August. Given everything else on the calendar, though, it will be hard for the trial to take place before the election. And if Trump wins he can make the case go away.',
    
    'Today we use computers for storing confidential data from various sectors such as banking, finance, health, personal property etc. We also use internet for transactions of information related to these sectors. But in many situations, the confidential data may be illegally used, and corrupted by unauthorised users. The increase in Internet traffic has led to a higher proportion of legal issues worldwide. So it is very necessary to protect such data from Cyber criminals. Cyber cases related to interference and investigation are increasing at an alarming rate. To control such crimes, it is necessary to follow ethics in field of computer. Cyber law is being amended quite regularly. Introduction to Cyberlaw is the area of law that deals with the Internet relationship to technological and electronic elements, including computers, software, hardware and information systems (IS). Cyberlaw is the part of the overall legal system that deals with the Internet, cyberspace, and their respective legal issues. Cyber law covers a fairly broad area, encompassing several subtopics including freedom of expression, access to and usage of the Internet, and online privacy. Advantages of Cyber Law the IT Act 2000 attempts to change out dated laws and provides ways to deal with cybercrimes. We need such laws so that. People can perform transactions over the Internet through credit cards without fear of misuse. The IT Act offers the much-needed legal framework so that information is not denied legal effect, validity or enforceability, solely on the ground that it is in the form of electronic records. In view of the growth in transactions and communications carried out through electronic records, the Act seeks to empower government departments to accept filing, creating and retention of official documents in the digital format. The IT Act has also proposed a legal framework for the authentication and origin of electronic records communications through digital signature. Computer Crime is alternatively referred to as cybercrime, e-crime, (electronic crime) or hi-tech crime. Computer crime is an act performed by a knowledgeable computer user, sometimes referred to as a hacker who illegally browses or steals a company or individual private information. In some cases, this person or group of individuals may be malicious and destroy or otherwise corrupt the computer or data files. Cyber-crimes can involve criminal activities that are traditional in nature, such as theft, fraud, forgery, defamation and mischief, all of which are subject to the Indian Penal Code. Software piracy is nothing but copyright violation of software created originally by an individual or an institution. It includes stealing of codes programs and other information illegally and creating the imitated copy by unauthorized means and utilizing this data either for own benefit or for profit making.',
    
    'England hopes of restoring some pride before leaving the Indian shores ended in an anti-climax of sorts, as their tour ended in an avalanche of wickets in the foothills of the Himalayas, giving the home side a handsome innings and 64-run win, and a 4-1 series triumph. Moments after recording the convincing win inside three days of the fifth and final Test in Dharamsala, a proud Rohit Sharma credited his young side for responding to the challenges despite multiple setbacks during the series. The unavailability of star players like Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, and Mohammed Shami has in a way put the onus on the younger players to prove them on the big stage and in a way stake their claim in the side. Yashasvi Jaiswal adjudged the Player of the series has had a fantastic series scoring in excess of 700 runs. Shubman Gill managed to shut down the critics after the initial setbacks. Sarfaraz Khan, Devdutt Padikkal and Dhruv Jurel scoring the runs, Ravichandran Ashwin emergency and his return the following day, it has been a dramatic series to say the least and India were able to conquer Bazball. At some stage people are going to go, we know that. All these guys are short on experience but they have played a lot of cricket. We have got to nurture them and make them understand the game. When put under pressure they responded pretty well. Credit goes to the entire team for that, Rohit said. We talk about scoring runs, but it is as important to take 20 wickets to win the Test match. Everyone, all the bowlers came and responded. They wanted to make a difference with the ball in hand, he added. Amidst the ignominious 1-4 series score line signalling England first major setback in the Bazball era, one Englishman scaled his own peak, with the 41 year-old James Anderson claiming his 700th Test wicket in the day opening exchanges, to raise the bar to a new high for other seam bowlers to scale. But the day and the Test belonged to another of Test cricket most enduring performers as off spinner Ashwin, in his landmark 100th Test, took his own tally to 516 and counting, with 5 for 77, his 36th five-wicket haul, to help India seal the victory inside two sessions on the third afternoon. England top three crumbled to Ashwin in the first 10 overs of the visitors second innings after India was bowled out for 477 in the first session of the day. England eventually lost five wickets inside just over half a session before lunch, with Ashwin accounting for four and Kuldeep taking one. Ashwin then completed his five-wicket haul with the wicket of Ben Foakes shortly after resumption of play after which Bumrah took two wickets in an over to reduce England to their last two.',
    
    'The brain has played an important role in human progress. As the human brain is more advanced than other animals, the changes in nature are observed by it. Humans have come to realize from their observations as per their ability that the origin, operation, and destruction of living things depend on soil, water, sunlight, air, and space, the five major elements found in nature. Call it as Panchatatva.Earth, water, fire, air and sky are Panchatatva. Assuming that all living or non-living things are made up of Panchatatva, the ideal way of life emerged by faithfully following the laws of nature while respecting these five tatvas (Panchatatva). In this way a close relationship developed between Indian culture and spirituality. As water is one of from Panchatatva, just like human life water has a unique significance in Indian culture. There was plenty of water in ancient times. In the Rigveda, the Yajurveda and the Atharvaveda has mention construction of dams to block river water, construction of canals to supply water to remote areas, it is also recorded that wells have been constructed for ground water use. But increasing human intervention has adversely affected the available water resources and today there is a crisis of water scarcity. Many descriptions of the ancient culture that flourished on the banks of the river Saraswati are found in Rigveda in various places. There are evidences of the existence of the river Saraswati even in the period of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Even today, geological evidence of the existence of the Saraswati River is being found, but it is said that this ancient river disappeared due to natural calamities. This means, as a river can create a culture, it can also destroy that culture. Although the American geologist Menzer is considered to be the pioneer person of modern groundwater science, about one and a half thousand years ago in India, Varahmihira wrote four chapters on the subject of water in his grantha Brihatsamhita. It gives the information about soil texture, botanical studies, ant hills near trees and deals with the relationship of groundwater to the behaviour of animals such as frog, fish, snake, lizard, monitor lizard, mongoose, cobra, turtle etc. Since Varahmihir lives in the area of black stone, his study have special importance in the region of black stone (Besalt) in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh. Indian culture has always been agricultural. Therefore, Parashar Muni had recorded useful observations in his grantha Krishi-Parashar in order to forecast the rain water required for agriculture. Also, how to block and store rain water is written in detail in the granth Kashyam Krishisuktam. In his observations, he had mentioned the direction of winds in different months, water level in the river basin, changes in the behaviour of ants, frogs, peacock, snakes, and the relation of the position of the Sun and planets, constellations to rain etc.',
    
    'The water is most important property on earth. Water is the origin of all living thing. In the life of an organism, water is next to oxygen. Therefore water is called life. Although water is the natural source due to its uneven distribution allocation, increasing demand and management, have currently being scarcity. Many water conservation schemes are implemented for public utility by the government in India. The schemes are implemented at state and central government level independently as well as it is also implemented with the joint participation of central and state government. The role of Local self-government bodies is an important in implementation for these schemes. For example water power campaign, Jalyukt Shiwar Yojana, Mahatma Phule water conservation planning, Atal groundwater planning, water storage planning in the period of Shivaji Maharaj etc. Any problem or public work is not successful with the participation of one person or a small group for that, the help (time, labour, skills, financial support etc.) provided by the villagers in various forms is important. To solve such variety of problems, everyone should come together and investigate the problems, do proper planning, to do implementation, evaluate them from time to time and to get rid of the problem it means public participation. Public participation is the original core of development. Nearly 75% of rural areas in Maharashtra are experiencing scarcity every year for drinking water and farming. The problem of water is being more complicated instead of relaxing. As a temporary solution to this, the needs are fulfill by supplying water by tanker. But this cannot be a permanent solution. Therefore public participation are important to solve the problem of water scarcity. To increase public participation organize various public awareness workshop, to organize and take the gramsabha, labour, cooperate to government employees, Prabhat Pheri, essay competition, speech competition and various activities. Youth board, farmers group, women savings groups, social institutions come together and avoid any claims, group crisis, political tactics are put aside so that water scarcity can definitely be overcome. Large scale water conservation works are being carried out in the universities with the participation of students and villagers under the National Service Scheme (N.S.S.). Topical water conservation is the key to successful water conservation in mountainous areas. Villages in such areas are often situated on a hill or plateau. So the water problem becomes more serious. The water is in deep valley or in a small stream in the valley. Since it is also on a slope, the water flows rapidly downhill and the ground water level goes down and the wells dry up. It is a major cause of water scarcity in many places. Successful water conservation in such places is based on the path of sustainable success of on-site water conservation planning and its completion with the participation of the village people. In this, water conservation plan is prepared by surveying the village.',
    
    'The first formed rocks on the Earth are igneous primary rocks. The term igneous, is derived from the Latin word igneous meaning fire. They are formed through cooling and solidification of magma or lava. These rocks may form with or without crystallization either below the surface, as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks. Magma may be derived from melting of pre-existing rocks either in the mantle or in crust. One or more processes such as increase in temperature, decrease in pressure, or change in composition cause melting. Minerals of the igneous rock are broadly classified into two groups viz.1) Primary and 2) Secondary. Primary minerals are the minerals which have developed as a result of crystallization from magma or lava (i.e., pyrogenetic minerals), while secondary minerals are those which are formed after the solidification of the rock either by alteration of the primary minerals or by precipitation from solution, in voids or vesicles of rocks. Primary minerals can be grouped into two, 1) essential and 2) accessory. Essential minerals are necessary for the classification, identification or nomenclature of the rock. Accessory minerals are present in small amounts and are therefore, not important in the nomenclature e.g., in granite, quartz and feldspar are essential minerals, while biotite and hornblende are accessory minerals. Presence or absence of accessory minerals does not make any difference in nomenclature of rocks. Secondary minerals are those which are formed from secondary solutions in cavities of igneous rocks, most commonly found in volcanic igneous rocks, e.g. calcite, zeolites etc. The minerals may be felsic or mafic. The felsic minerals are light in colour, with low specific gravity, e.g., minerals from silica and feldspar groups. Mafic minerals are dark coloured, with higher specific gravity, e.g. minerals belonging to pyroxene, amphibole, mica, olivine groups and iron ores. Rocks are described as a phaneric or phanero-crystalline, if their minerals can be distinguished separately with the naked eye, e.g. a coarse grained rock like granite. Rocks, in which the mineral grains cannot be distinguished by the naked eye, are described as aphanitic, e.g. fine grained rocks like basalt or rhyolite. Rocks, which solidify on the Earth surface from lava, are described as volcanic rocks. The lavas may have erupted either from a volcano or through fissures. A very rapid rate of cooling of the lava makes these rocks fine grained or even glassy. They show characteristic features such as vesicles, amygdales and flow structure. Volcanic rocks may show in equigranular textures under the microscope, e.g., basalt. The hypabyssal rocks consolidate at a depth in between volcanic and plutonic depths. They show characters which are intermediate between plutonic and the volcanic rocks, e.g. dolerite.',
    
    'The young lift-man in a City office that threw a passenger out of his lift the other morning and was fined for the offence was undoubtedly in the wrong. It was a question of Please. The complainant entering the lift, said, Top. The lift-man demanded Top-please, and this concession being refused he not only declined to comply with the instruction, but hurled the passenger out of the lift. This, of course was carrying a comment on manner too far. Discourtesy is not a legal offence, and it does not excuse assault and battery. If a burglar breaks into my house and I knock him down, the law will acquit me, and if I am physically assaulted, it will permit me to retaliate with reasonable violence. It does this because the burglar and my assailant have broken quite definite commands of the law. But no legal system could attempt to legislate against bad manners, or could sanction the use of violence against something which it does not itself recognize as a legally punishable offence. And our sympathy with the lift-man, we must admit that the law is reasonable. It would never do if we were at liberty to box people ears because we did not like their behaviour, or the tone of their voices, or the scowl on their faces. Our fists would never be idle, and the gutters of the city would run with blood all day. I may be as uncivil as I may please and the law will protect me against violent retaliation. I may be haughty or boorish and there is no penalty to pay except the penalty of being written down an ill-mannered fellow. The law does not compel me to say Please or to attune my voice to other people sensibilities any more than it says that I shall not wax my moustache or dye my hair or wear ringlets down my back. It does not recognize the laceration of our feelings as a case for compensation. There is no allowance for moral and intellectual damages in these matters. This does not mean that the damages are negligible. It is probable that the lift-man was much more acutely hurt by what he regarded as a slur upon his social standing than he would have been if he had a kick on the shins, for which he could have got a legal redress. The pain of a kick on the shins soon passes away but the pain of a wound to our self-respect or our vanity may poison a whole day. I can imagine that lift-man, denied the relief of throwing the author of his wound out of the lift, brooding over the insult by the hour, and visiting his wife in the evening as the only way of restoring his equilibrium. For there are few things more catching than bad temper and bad manners. When Sir Anthony Absolute bullied Captain Absolute, the latter went out and bullied his man, Fag, whereupon Fag went out downstairs and kicked the pageboy.',
    
    'There is a revolution in the life style of people which has been affected by Big Data. Our food habits, our health care, our travelling, our scientific pursuits, you name it and everything has changed 360 degrees. The massive data available with us can really work wonders. Friends, do you know what happens when we like a post on Facebook or share a post on Whatsapp, visit any website, make online purchases, or watch videos? Yes, whatever activity we do online is recorded, monitored and analysed. So a huge amount of data is collected. Let me give you an idea of how huge the data might be. Big Data can be petabytes or Exabyte of data consisting of billions to trillions of records of millions of people all from different sources, for example web, sales, customer contact centre, social media, mobile data and so on. The data available to industries and companies is enormously increasing in volume, variation, velocity, veracity and value. Such a Big Data is easy to obtain but so massive that it challenges the current computing technologies and hence Big Data analytics is used to give insights that were previously incomprehensible. Big Data analytics is the complex process of examining large and varied data sets or Big Data to uncover information such as hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends and customer preferences. With such a huge data available with the industries they can have innumerable advantages hence all the industries are trying to reap the maximum benefit from it. Many industries have advanced by miles from their competitors. It is not the amount of data that is important but what the organizations do with the data is what matters. Big Data has been useful in identifying and tracking the exact location of a place. Your GPS and Google Maps make use of Big Data. With geographic positioning and radio frequency identification sensors we get the real-time data about traffic, congestion on a particular route, information if the route is closed or if it is a one way route, understanding accident prone areas etc. You can plan your own route according to the travel time and the transportation of goods. If you have ordered something online you can track the location of your goods in transit, you can also track the condition of the goods. This has immensely helped the logistics companies to reduce risks in transport, improve speed and reliability in delivery.',
    
    'A Brunton compass, properly known as the Brunton Pocket Transit, is a precision compass made by Brunton, Inc. of Riverton, Wyoming. The Pocket Transit may be adjusted for declination angle according to one location on the Earth. It is used to get directional degree measurements (azimuth) through use of the Earth magnetic field. Holding the compass at waist height, the user looks down into the mirror and lines up the target, needle, and guide line that is on the mirror. Once all three are lined up and the compass is level, the reading for that azimuth can be made. Arguably the most frequent use for the Brunton in the field is the calculation of the strike and dip of geological features (faults, contacts, foliation, sedimentary strata, etc.). Strike is measured by levelling (with the bull eye level) the compass along the plane being measured. Dip is taken by laying the side of the compass perpendicular to the strike measurement and rotating horizontal level until the bubble is stable and the reading has been made. If field conditions allow, additional features of the compass allow users to measure such geological attributes from a distance. As with most traditional compasses, directional measurements are made in reference to the Earth magnetic field. Thus, measurements are sensitive to magnetic interference. For example, if the user is near an outcrop that contains magnetite or some other iron bearing material, compass readings can be affected anywhere from several inches from the outcrop to tens of yards away (depending on the strength of the magnetic field). Since they are measured with a rotating level, dip measurements are unaffected by magnetic interference. The dip angle and amount measured in a direction other than perpendicular the strike direction is called apparent dip. True dip is always greater than apparent dip. The apparent dip of the inclined bed will vary according to the direction in which it is measured; being zero parallel to strike and increasing in other directions till it is equal to the true dip when the direction of measurement is perpendicular to the strike. When a set of layers are subjected to compressive forces, they bend upward or downward. Such bends in rocks are called folds. These bends or curves are a result of permanent deformation due to tectonic forces. Folds may occur singly, isolated or as extensive fold trains of different sizes. A set of folds distributed on a regional scale constitutes a fold belt, a common feature in organic zones.',
    
    'National Income is one of the important subject matter of macroeconomics. The national economy comprises of all the firms and factories, shops and markets, banks and financial institutions, various departments and their offices etc. National income is a composite measure of all economic activities such as production, distribution, exchange and consumption, but is also an objective indicator of economic welfare of the people in a country. In India, establishment of the National Income Committee (NIC) in 1949 marked the beginning of Government efforts for regular compilation of National Income estimates. At present, Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) compiles and publishes data on national income and allied aggregates every year. Modern economy is a money economy. Hence, national income of a country is expressed in terms of money. The total income of the nation is called national income. In real terms, national income is the flow of goods and services produced in an economy during a year. The National Income Commitee was appointed by the Government of India in August 1949 with Prof. P. C. Mahalanobis as Chairman and Prof. D. R. Gadgil and Dr. V. K. R. V. Rao as the members. According to NIC A national estimate measures the volume of commodities and services turned out during a given period counted without duplication. National income represents income of the economy as a whole rather than that of an individual. Hence it is a macroeconomic concept. In order to avoid double counting in national income, the value of only final goods and 7 National Income 62 services produced in the economy are considered. The value of intermediate goods or raw materials is not considered. For example, while estimating the production of shirts, there is no need to take the value of cotton, as it is already included in the price of the shirts. National income includes net value of goods and a service produced and does not include depreciation cost. ( i.e. wear and tear of capital assets). National income includes net income from abroad i.e. difference between export value and import value (X-M) and net difference between receipts from abroad and payments made abroad (R-P). National income is always expressed with reference to a time period. In India, it is from 1st April to 31st March. National income is a flow concept as it shows flow of goods and services produced in the economy during a year. National income is always expressed in monetary terms. It represents only those goods and services which are exchanged for money.',
    
    'There are two types of organisations 1) Trading organisations or Profit making organisations and 2) Non - Trading or Not for Profit organisations Trading organisations main object is to earn Profit. They are engaged in trading activities. i.e. Buying and selling of goods and services, organisations like Sole Trading concern Partnership Co-Operative organisations, Public Limited Company etc. are set up for the purpose of making profit. Final Accounts which consists of Trading and Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet are prepared. Base of Final Accounts is Trial Balance. Not for Profit organisations main aim is to give service to its members or to the society at large. They are not formed for Profit making. They do not carry any Trading activity or manufacturing activity. Sports club, Charitable Hospitals, Schools, Colleges, Universities, Trade Unites, Chamber of Commerce, Professional Institutions, Trusts, Social Welfare Associations, Religious concerns, Libraries etc. are examples of Not for Profit concern. Their main object is to give services to the members. They maintain the books of accounts in a different way. As their motive is not to earn Profit Not for Profit concerns do not prepare Profit and Loss Account, instead they prepare Income and Expenditure Account. Similarly they do not prepare Trial Balance but they prepared Receipts and Payments Account. These organisations prepare Balance Sheet to know the Net Worth of the concern on a particular date. Final Accounts of not for profit concern consists of Income and Expenditure Accounts and Balance Sheet. Not for Profit Concerns are those concern which are not started to earn Profit but to give qualitative service to its members and society at the minimum charges. Their main objective is to provide social service and to promote art, culture, sports, education etc. The nature of these concerns is different from Profit organisations. Not for Profit concerns collect income through subscription, admission fees, donations etc. given by members or non-members and grants subsidies or concessions received form the Government. The primary objective of such concerns is to provide services to its members and not to earn profit. These concerns are formed for promotion of art, culture, education, sports, charity, health, etc. The members of these concerns cannot get the dividend. It is prohibited. The management of such concerns is done by elected representatives of members. It is governed by elected members. These concerns prepare Receipts and payments Account, Income and Expenditure Account and Balance Sheet. Capital Fund is created by such concerns. It is made up of Entrance fees, Surplus, Legacies and donations specially received for Capital Fund.',
    
    'Public finance is one of the old branches of economics which highlights the role and functions of the government in an economy. Government is a formal or informal institution created by the people in a specific region to perform various functions such as protection from external attacks, protection of private property of the people, generation of employment, maintaining internal law and order, provision of social needs like education, health, etc. Protection from external attacks, maintaining internal law and order etc. are obligatory functions of the government. Provision of education and health services, provision of social security like pensions and other welfare measures etc. are optional functions of the government. To perform the above mentioned functions, adequately and efficiently, any government needs funds which can be received from various sources. The concept of public finance is a combination of two words public and finance, Public is a collective for the individuals living within an administrative territory. In economics, it is used to signify the government which represents the public. Finance simply means income and expenditure. Thus, public finance is nothing but a study of the principles of income and expenditure of the government at central, state and local levels. This study is done under the public finance branch in economics. According to Hugh Dalton Public finance is one of those subjects which are on the borderline between economics and politics. It is concerned with the income and expenditure of public authorities and with the adjustment of one with the other. Since we study the activities of the governments in political science too, public finance also constitutes a part of the study of political science. According to Prof. Findlay Shirras Public finance is the study of the principles underlying the spending and raising of funds by public authorities. Public expenditure is that expenditure which is incurred by the public authority [Central, State and Local Bodies] for protection of their citizens, for satisfying their collective needs and for promoting their economic and social welfare. Till 20th century, the majority of the governments had adopted a policy of laissez faire. Under this policy, the functions of government were restricted to the obligatory functions. But, the modern governments not only perform the obligatory functions such as defence and civil administration, but also perform optional functions for promoting social and economic development of their countries. Therefore, study of public expenditure is an important part of study of public finance.',
    
    'The ability of a customer to obtain goods or services before payment, based on trust. When goods or services are obtained and payment will be made in the future it is known as credit transaction. Credit transactions play a significant role in the world of business. Credit motivates the customers to increase the amount of their spending. Moreover, business enterprises offer credit to gain a competitive advantage in the market. To balance the potential for increased sales with the risk of decreased cash flow and large outstanding debts the seller requires some sort of commitment or promise from the costumer that he would pay the amount of goods, due from him on a particular date in future. To avoid any conflict or misunderstanding about payments, instruments of credit like bill of exchange and Promissory Notes are issued. In India instruments of credit have been in use a long time and are popularly known as Hundies. Commercial practice has flourished to treat bill of exchange and promissory notes as valuable instruments of credit to an extent that when a written promise is made in proper form and on proper stamp paper it is understood that the customer has discharged his debt and the seller has received payment. Also, these written promises are accepted by bank and money is advanced against it. Moreover, the instruments being negotiable instruments can be transferred from one person to another. Negotiable instrument Act, 1881 states that Negotiable instrument means promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or bearer. A bill of exchange is a written acknowledgment of debt and also a promise to pay the debt according to the terms of the bill. A bill of exchange is generally drawn by the creditor on his debtor and should be accepted by the debtor Section 5 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 defines Bill of Exchange as a bill of exchanges is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order, signed by the maker, directing a certain person to pay certain sum of money only to, or to the order of a certain person, or to the bearer of the instrument. Drawer is person who draws or makes the bill and signs on it. He is the creditor, who is entitled to receive the money from debtor. For the Drawer the instrument is his Bills Receivable, since he has to receive the amount of the bill. Drawee is the person on whom the bill is drawn. He has to accept the bill drawn on him. He is the debtor who has to pay money to creditor. For the Drawee the instrument is his Bills payable, since he has to pay the amount of the bill. Payee is the person to whom the payment is to be made.',
    
    'Brevity is the soul of wit is one of the countless maxims coined by William Shakespeare. It is relevant to speaking as well as writing. Brevity or Concision is the cutting out of unnecessary words while conveying an idea. It aims to enhance communication by eliminating redundancy without omitting important information. Summary Writing is one of its kinds that have been described as one of the elementary principles of writing. To speak what is required and to write what is necessary is a requisite towards the development of language skills. It is important to be brief in written expression. To express in brief the main points of a written record, is the summary writing skill and that can be developed by practice. Summarising has a definite purpose. The purpose of a summary is to give the reader a clear, objective picture of the original text. Most importantly, the summary restates only the main points of a text or a lecture without giving examples or details, such as dates, numbers or statistics. Learning Disability (LD) is an umbrella term for a wide variety of learning problems. Children with learning disorder might be labelled as slow learners but they are as smart as everyone else. They just need to be taught in proper environment conducive to their learning speed and level. Observations of a child over a period of time by parents Learning Disability (LD) is an umbrella term for a wide variety of learning problems. Children with learning disorder might be labelled as slow learners but they are as smart as everyone else. They just need to be taught in proper environment conducive to their learning speed and level. Observations of a child over a period of time by parent sat home and teachers in school can provide valuable information about the way a child is able to learn and function in all the ways that he should be able to, at his age and level. There may be certain apparent problems while reading, writing, listening, speaking, reasoning and dealing with Maths. Once these problems are identified it is time for proper investigation. It is important in order to clarify specific learning disorders and also rule out any other issue affecting the student educational progress. Investigations may reveal various types of disorders like Dyslexia, (APD), ADHD etc. Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Central Auditory Processing Disorder, is a condition that affects the sound that travels unimpeded through the ear, is processed or interpreted by the brain. Individuals with APD do not recognize subtle differences between sounds and Dysgraphia, Dyscalculia, specific reading disability, Auditory Processing Disorder words.',
    
    'Occasional self-medication has always been part of normal living. The making and selling of drugs has a long history and is closely linked, like medical practice itself, with belief in magic. Only during the last hundred years or so, the development of scientific techniques made, diagnosis possible. The doctor is now able to follow up the correct diagnosis of many illnesses with specific treatment of their causes. In many other illnesses of which the causes remain unknown, he is still limited, like the unqualified prescriber, to the treatment of symptoms. The doctor is trained to decide when to treat symptoms only and when to attack the cause. This is the essential difference between medical prescribing and self-medication. The advancement in technology has brought about much progress in some fields of medicine, including the development of scientific drug therapy. In many countries public health organization is improving and people nutritional standards have risen. Parallel with such beneficial trends are two which have an adverse effect. One is the use of high pressure advertising by the pharmaceutical industry which has tended to influence both patients and doctors and has led to the overuse of drugs generally. The other is emergence of eating, insufficient sleep, excessive smoking and drinking. People with disorders arising from faulty habits such as these, as well as from unhappy human relationships, often resort to self-medication and so add the taking of pharmaceuticals to the list. Advertisers go to great lengths to catch this market. Clever advertising, aimed at chronic sufferers who will try anything because doctors have not been able to cure them, can induce such faith in a preparation, particularly if cheaply priced, that it will produce by suggestion a very real effect in some people. Advertisements are also aimed at people suffering from mild complaints such as simple cold and coughs which clear up by themselves within a short time. These are the main reasons why laxatives, indigestion remedies, painkillers, cough mixtures, tonics, vitamin and iron tablets, nose drops, ointments and many other preparations are found in quantity in many households. It is doubtful whether taking these things ever improves a person health, it may even make it worse. Worse, because the preparation may contain unsuitable ingredients; worse because the taker may become dependent on them; worse because they might be taken excess; worse because they may cause poisoning, and worst of all because symptoms of some serious underlying cause may be asked and therefore medical help may not be sought. Self-diagnosis is a greater danger than self-medication.',
    
    'Water occurs underground in two zones separated by water table. The level beneath which all the pore spaces in the rocks are filled with water is known as water table. The zone extending from the water table to an impermeable layer is called saturated zone, wherein all voids are completely filled with water. In this zone, water is held at a pressure greater than the atmospheric pressure, and hence it moves in a direction based on the continuous hydraulic situation. The zone between the ground surface and the top of capillary fringe is called unsaturated zone (zone of aeration) which consists of voids (pores or interstices) partially filled with water and partially with air. Water is held at a pressure less than the atmospheric pressure in the unsaturated zone. Zone between bottom of the unsaturated zone and top of the water table is called capillary zone, wherein most voids are filled with water but the water is held at a pressure less than the atmospheric pressure. The unsaturated zone can be further subdivided into soil-water zone and intermediate zone. This zone between the ground surface and the top of water table is known as the vadose zone and is part of the unsaturated zone and capillary zone (also known as capillary fringe). Water present in the vadose zone is called vadose water, and is held at a pressure less than the atmospheric pressure. The term vadose zone is technically more appropriate than the conventional term of unsaturated zone because portions of the vadose zone may actually be saturated, even though the pressure of water is below the atmospheric pressure. Broadly speaking, the water stored in the zone of saturation is called as groundwater. However, not all underground water is groundwater, rather only free water or gravitational water (the water that moves freely under the force of gravity into wells) constitutes the groundwater. Therefore, a practical explanation of groundwater as given by Bouwer in 1978 is Groundwater is that portion of the water beneath the Earth surface, which can be collected through wells, tunnels, or drainage galleries, or which flows naturally to the Earth surface via seeps or springs. Inter-granular spaces vary widely in terms of size. Minute voids between the component particles of clay, shale and slate may feature on one end, while large spaces between the pebbles of well-sorted and unconsolidated valley gravel may feature on the other end of the spectrum. Massive spaces are those that occur between large blocks of rocks such as fractures, joints and bedding planes sometimes enlarged by the process of solution.',
    
    'The budgetary provisions of public expenditure and revenue need to be at different levels as per the changing needs of the economy. Accordingly, Government budget is of three types: 1) Balanced Budget 2) Surplus Budget 3) Deficit Budget. 1) Balanced Budget: Government budget is said to be balanced, when estimated revenue and expenditure of the government are equal. That is, Government Receipts Government Expenditure. The concept of a balanced budget was advocated by the classical economists like Adam Smith. It was considered as neutral in its effect on the working of the economy and hence, they regarded it as the best. However, modern economists believe that the policy of balanced budget may not always be suitable for the economy. The modern Governments are welfare entities and hence, they cannot keep their expenditure at the level of their receipts. 2) Surplus Budget: Government budget is said to be surplus, when estimated Government receipts are more than the estimated Government expenditure. i. e. anticipated Government Receipts estimated Government Expenditure. A surplus budget may prove useful during the period of inflation. In the period of inflation, there is a tendency for prices to rise rapidly. This needs to be checked, particularly in the interest of those who have more or less a fixed income. The rise in prices can be checked by lowering the level of effective demand in the economy. This can be done by increasing taxes which would increase the revenue of the government and reduce the purchasing power of the people. As a result, the aggregate demand will fall leading to downward movement in the price level. Thus, inflationary pressures can be controlled. However, a surplus budget should not be used in the situations other than inflation as it may lead to unemployment and low levels of output in an economy. 3) Deficit Budget: Government budget is said to be deficit, when anticipated Government receipts are less than the estimated Government expenditure. That is anticipated Government Receipts estimated Government expenditure. A deficit budget may prove useful during the period of depression. In the period of depression, all economic activities are at low level which results in unemployment. This can be checked by increasing Government expenditure, by borrowing money and through deficit financing. This will increase employment and aggregate effective demand for goods and services which would encourage further investment. In modern times, deficit budget is the most commonly implemented policy of any Government. Developing countries like India have consistently resorted to deficit budget technique for economic development.',
    
    'Scholars suggest that the available discourses on religious practices are layered and complex. As far back as the Harappan civilisation, figurines of male Gods, Mother Goddess and animal deities have been found. However, there is no evidence for the existence of temples or idol worship. Natural elements such as sun, rain, water, thunder and so on were venerated. With the passage of time, possibly, some of the hymns came to be associated with the veneration of deities such as Indra, Agni, Surya, Yama etc. Indigenous tribal communities would have had their own systems of religious beliefs. Tribal religions had neither labels nor any written scriptures. Thus, most of what is known about tribal belief systems is based on references made in ancient religious texts, medieval records and colonial ethnographies. Anthropologists have classified tribal belief systems by various terms like animism, totemism etc. As regards the Hindu way of life, there are many literary sources that shed light on beliefs and practices of the Vedic period some are written and some are oral traditions, such as Vedas, Upa Vedas, Vedangas, Brahmanas, Aranykas, and Epics etc. The Vedic period is usually divided into Early Vedic Period (c.1500 BCE to c.1000 BCE) and Later Vedic Period (c.1000 BCE to c.500 BCE). One of the reasons for this is there is significant changes that take place, about which we shall discuss as we go long. For Hindus, the Puranas and Dharmashastras laid out a Code of Conduct based on the Law of Karma (Action), which is also known as the law of cause and effect. You may have heard the phrase, as you sow, so shall you reap. Hindus believe in a cyclical world view, that is, they believe that the deeds in one life determine the next life. The atman (soul) is trapped in the bondage of birth and rebirth, until it can attain moksha (salvation). The four aims of Hindu life Scholars suggest that society in the Early Vedic period was less rigid with respect to occupation-based divisions. Over a period of time however, the rigidification of varnas (discussed later) into a fixed, closed system of stratification emerged. This came to be called jati (assigned by birth). The Jati system was anchored in Brahminism that suggested that hierarchy was subsequently based on the principle of purity and pollution. This meant strict endogamy, excessive ritualism and the emergence of discrete boundaries of inclusion and exclusion.',
    
    'Earthquakes are explained by plate tectonics and the elastic rebound theory. The elastic rebound theory was proposed by H.F. Reid of Johns Hopkins University in 1906. It says that the constant motion of rocks along one side of a fault boundary causes the rocks on the opposite side to bend. The bending leads to a build-up of elastic energy which is created when a rock is deformed elastically, like a stretched rubber band. Rocks can also be deformed non elastically, as a combination of the two. Frictional forces holding the rocks together are overcome and the rocks break at the weakest point along the fault plane, known as the focus of the earthquake. The deformed rock experiences slippage and then snaps back to its original position. The energy released by this slippage causes earthquake vibrations. The energy released by the earthquake travels through the Earth in the form of waves classified as primary (P), secondary (S) and surface waves (L and R). The sudden breaking also called rupture usually results when the tectonic forces develop the strain beyond the limit of their strength (the elastic limit). When the shear forces are steadily increased between the two blocks of rocks separated by an existing fault, initially there is no movement. Finally, when the strain exceeds the strength of the fault, it results in rupture that extends rapidly along the fault plane. This allows the blocks on either side of it to return into less strained state. The energy that had been accumulating over time in the strained volume of rock is then suddenly released. Science of seismology deals with the fundamental concepts of origin of the earthquake and its tectonic relationship, behaviour of rocks under different stress conditions, locating the earthquake, measuring the energy released by an earthquake, earthquake prediction and recurrence, building of earthquake resistant structures and long term behavior of faults. The seismogram is the record that consists of various types of zig-zag lines that are intermittently recorded in between almost straight lines. The zig-zag lines represent the seismic waves generated by the earthquake, while straight lines are characteristic of the quiet time span, when there is no seismicity. The second type of waves called surface waves travel along the surface of the Earth are divided into L waves and R waves. The L waves moves ground from side to side like a snake moves whereas the R waves roll the ground apparently up and down. The surface waves are most damaging to property and infrastructure.',
    
    'Finance is the backbone of an economy. Finance, basically refers to the management of money. It includes funds needed by individuals, business houses and the Government for various purposes. Thus, finance is categorized as personal finance, corporate finance and public finance. The financial system of the country is responsible for the mobilization and allocation of funds. It helps in creation of wealth which is vital for the economic development of the country. The financial system in India comprises of financial institutions, financial markets, financial instruments and financial services. This chapter deals exclusively with financial markets in India. Financial markets are an important component of the financial system. Financial market refers to a market where sale and purchase of financial assets such as bonds, stocks, derivatives, government securities, foreign currency etc. is undertaken. Financial markets operate through banks, nonbanking financial institutions, brokers, mutual funds, discount houses etc. Financial markets include two distinct markets i.e. the Money market and Capital market. Money market is a market for lending and borrowing of short term funds. It is a market for near money i.e. short term instruments such as trade bills, government securities, promissory notes etc. Such instruments are highly liquid, less risky and easily marketable with a maturity period of one year or less than one year. The money market in India is dichotomous by nature. It comprises of both, the organized sector as well as the unorganized sector. The organized sector includes the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), commercial banks, co-operative banks, development financial institutions, investment institutions and the Discount and Finance House of India (DFHI). The unorganized sector on the other hand, comprises of indigenous bankers, money lenders and unregulated nonbank financial intermediaries. Money market centres in India are located at Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. However, Mumbai is the only active money market centre in India with money flowing in from all parts of the country. The organised sector of the money market consists of the Reserve Bank of India, commercial banks, co-operative banks, regulated financial intermediaries etc. Let us now discuss the organized sector of the money market in India. Every country in the world has a Central Bank which is at the apex of the banking system. It is entrusted with the responsibility of regulating the money market in the country. Reserve Bank of India is the central bank of our country. RBI was set up on the basis of the recommendations of the Hilton Young Commission. The RBI Act of 1934 provides the statutory basis of the functions of the bank. RBI commenced its operations on 1st April, 1935 as a private shareholder bank. RBI was nationalized on 1st January, 1949. It is the most important constituent of the money market.',
    
    'The half-yearly report of the Students Council was on November 15th, and was one of the important days in the calendar of Greens lade School. I had heard quite a deal about these occasions and became as excited as the children as the day approached. It was entirely their day, arranged, presented and controlled by them. I observed the activities of my class as they prepared for it, noting with pride the business-like way in which tasks were allocated and fitted into a neat programme. There were whispered conferences with members of other classes in the arrangement of it. On that day there was no assembly. The children arrived smartly dressed and polished, and Miss Joseph and Denham, who seemed to be the important officials for the occasion, moved about among their colleagues ensuring that each one was ready to play his (her) part. A bell was rung at 10.00 a.m. and everyone trooped into the auditorium to sit together in classes. Miss Joseph and Denham, the two most senior students, sat on the stage, one on each side of Mr. Florian, who, as soon as everyone was seated and silent, stood and addressed the school. He spoke at length, reiterating the aims and policy of the school and of the important contribution each child could make to the furtherance of those aims. He gave praise wherever it was indicated, but insisted that there was yet a great deal to be done, by themselves, towards a general improvement in conduct, cleanliness and the pursuit of knowledge. As I listened I realised that this man was in no way remote from his school; his remarks all showed that he identified himself with it and everyone in it. He then wished them success with the Council Meeting and left the stage to tremendous applause. Things now moved quickly into gear. First, Miss Joseph stood up, and gave a short explanation of the Council purpose and its activities. Each class would report, through its representatives, on the studies pursued during the half year which began after Easter, a representative having been chosen for each subject. When all the classes had completed their reports a panel of teachers would be invited to occupy the stage and answer questions from the body of the hall on matters arising out of the various reports. The selection of the panel, as with everything else, was entirely at the discretion of the children and no members of the staff knew either how many or which teachers would be invited to sit. The reports began with the lowest or youngest class first. These were mainly twelve year olds who had joined the school the previous summer. Most of them were shy and rather frightened at standing up before the entire school, but nevertheless they managed it creditably; they had been newly introduced to the difficulties of seeking information for themselves, so their report was understandably rather short.',
    
    'India is basically an agricultural country having the primary source of livelihood for 54.6 percent of India population and contributes 17.4 percent to the country total Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Livestock is an integral part of Agriculture, in fact the Indian economy is closely knit with agriculture and livestock and both are crucial for overall food security. Now a day agriculture sector is undergoing a historic change as livestock has surpassed the economy of food grain and today finally the policy makers of country recognized livestock as the engine of agriculture growth. Besides providing cheap and nutritious food to millions of people, animal husbandry is playing a significant role in generating gainful employment in the rural areas, particularly among the landless, small and marginal farmers and women. According to National Survey Scheme (NSS, 2013), 23 percent agricultural households 16.44 million workers are engaged in the activities of farming of animals. Employment in livestock sector is fast catching and has implications for poverty too. It has been observed that rural poverty is less in states where livestock contributes more to farm income. India is basically an agricultural country and it is likely to be so, in future to come. Out of the total land holding 30 percent is held by small and marginal farmers. They manage 80 percent of total livestock in the country. Livestock production is more impressive than that of food grain production. The activity of livestock production is largely confined to the rural sector as land, labour, capital and organization are the basic resources available in the rural sector. These four factors of livestock production are roped in proportionately to augment the production of finished goods; namely milk, meat, pork, wool and related multifarious products of commercial importance. These products follow their regular path ways of processing, preservation, pricing and quality control. The age old format of conventional dairy management is being transformed into a more meaningful and scientific form, based on improved breeding, feeding, heeding, housing and health cover practices. Apart from milk, meat, eggs, wool and leather, various animal species are also used for draught power, companionship, entertainment, research experimentation, sports, security etc. Fortunately, India has blessed with tremendous livestock wealth, both in terms of number as well as diversity. This is endeavored with the complexity to sustain under harsh climatic conditions with scarce resources. Livestock plays an important role in Indian economy. About 20.5 million people depend upon livestock for their livelihood. Livestcok contributed 16 percent to the income of small farm households as against an average of 14 percent for all rural households.',
    
    'Environment is not a single subject; it is an integration of several subjects that includes both Natural science as well as social science. To understand all the aspects of our environment, we need to know about life sciences, chemistry, physics, geography, resource management, economics, and engineering and social science, population, issues of poverty, resource use and allied issues. Thus the scope of environment education is extremely wide and covers some aspects of nearly every major discipline. If we study the natural history of the areas in which we live, we would see that our surroundings were originally a natural landscape such as forest, river, mountain, desert, marine environment or a combination of these elements. Most of us live on landscapes that have been profoundly modified by human beings into villages towns or cities. We get our food supply from surrounding villages which in turn, are dependent on natural landscapes such as forests, grasslands and rivers for resources. The industrial development and intensive agricultural practices that provide the goods for our increasing consumer oriented society uses up a large amount of natural resources. Consequently, these will get exhausted in the near future. If we continue to extract them. There will be nothing left for the next generations. Rapid economic growth and unplanned development has inevitably led to environmental degradation. The environment affects us in many ways due to weather changes and quality of air and water. We in turn affect the natural environment often negatively. We cut trees or throw away our garbage, which has an adverse effect on the environment. In the industrialized era that we live in today, every component of our environment such as air, water or food are impacted by industrial activities, infrastructure development, population explosion and pollution. Since 1970, many National and International Conferences have been held, to enhance environmental awareness. However, most people recognize the urgent need for more information and action through environmental education. India is one of the major countries having large number of NGO working on environmental awareness campaigns. The role of mass media and various public institutions that furthered environment awareness is a key to better environmental management. This will need to integrate economic long term growth with the needs of environmental conservation. Increasing population, urbanization and poverty have generated pressure on natural resources and led to environmental degradation. To prevent the environment from further degradation, Honrable Supreme Court of India has ordered and initiated environmental protection awareness programs through government and non-government agencies who must take part in protecting our environment.',
    
    'Before 1947, the pattern of India foreign trade was typically colonial. India was a supplier of raw materials to the industrialized nations, particularly England and importer of manufactured goods. This dependence on foreign trade did not permit industrialization at home. As a result the indigenous handicrafts suffered a severe blow. However, many underdeveloped countries that won independence in the post-World War II period, viewed foreign trade as an investment. Buying and selling of goods and services within the boundaries of a nation are referred to as Internal Trade or Domestic Trade or Home Trade. For example, if goods produced in Maharashtra are sold to states like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu etc, then it is known as internal trade. Foreign Trade is trade between the different countries of the world. It is called as International Trade or External Trade. According to Wasserman and Hultman, International Trade consists of transaction between residents of different countries. Import trade refers to purchase of goods and services by one country from another country or inflow of goods and services from foreign country to home country. For example, India imports petroleum from Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, etc. Export trade refers to the sale of goods by one country to another country or outflow of goods from one country to foreign country. For example, India exports tea, rice, jute to China, Hong Kong, Singapore etc. Entrepot trade refers to purchase of goods and services from one country and then selling them to another country after some processing operations. For example, Japan imports raw material required to make electronic goods like, radio, washing machine, television etc. from England, Germany, and France etc. and sells them to various countries in the world after processing them. Trade is an engine of growth of an economy, because it plays an important role for economic development. In developed countries it represents a significant share of Gross Domestic Product. Foreign trade provides foreign exchange which can be used for very productive purposes. Foreign trade is a remarkable factor in expanding the market and encouraging the production of goods. Foreign trade creates an opportunity for the producers to reach beyond the domestic markets. It encourages them to produce more goods for export. This leads to an increase in total investment in an economy. Foreign trade leads to division of labour and specialization at world level. Some countries have abundant natural resources, they should export raw material and import finished goods from countries which are advanced in skilled manpower. Thus, foreign trade gives benefits to all countries thereby leading to division of labour and specialization.',
    
    'Religious scriptures as well as historical studies indicate that Indian women enjoyed a comparatively high status during the early Vedic period. This is not to be understood as if women enjoyed an equal status with men. Patriarchal value systems were in operation then and they still continue to this day. Women during the Early Vedic period had access to Vedic education; they were entitled to the upanayana (thread) ceremony which enabled them entry into the Gurukul system of education. The Rig Veda renders the highest status to qualified women. Educated women were divided into two categories: Sadyavadhu those who pursued their education just until they were married and Brahmavadinis those who never married and continued studying and imparting education throughout their lives. Vedas and Vedangas were taught to women too, but later became limited to religious songs and poems necessary for rituals. Some notable Vedic and Upanishadic women scholars were Apala, Indrani, Ghosha, Lopamudra, Gargi and Maitreyi. Women were considered as useful and productive members of society. They could participate in social assemblies (vidath). They were also permitted to choose their life partners for marriage. Marriage was considered a sacrament and was irrevocable, though not compulsory. The main form of marriage was monogamy. There is mention of Anuloma and Pratiloma marriage in the Upanishads. In the Later Vedic period, the caste system and Brahminic supremacy became entrenched. Caste groups became rigid with the passage of time. The Varna system now turned into an oppressive Jati (caste) system. In all this, women became doubly oppressed. Since education for girls was stopped, so was the sacrament of upanayana (thread ceremony) which initiated them into the Gurukul. It was replaced with marriage (vivaha) and moreso, child marriage. Marriage now became the only sacrament (samskar) permissible for women. You will observe that even though women had a relatively better status in the Early Vedic period, when compared to the Later Vedic period, as regards social and legal aspects, they did not have equal rights with their male counterparts. They did not possess the right to property. The Later Vedic period witnessed a decline in the status of women in society. Women were now restricted to household duties and were barred from attending social assemblies. They were reduced to a subordinate status in the household. The family system continued to be patriarchal and descent was patrilineal. Hence women were more rigidly subjected to the three obediences, viz. father (before marriage), husband (after marriage) and son (after the husband death). The birth of a daughter began to be looked down upon and there is evidence to suggest the beginning of the practice of dowry. The Gautam Dharma Sutra advocated that girls should be married off before attaining puberty so as to ensure purity and chastity.',
    
    'Phileas Fogg was in prison. He had been shut up in the Custom House, and he was to be transferred to London the next day. Passe-partout, when he saw his master arrested, would have fallen upon Fix had he not been held back by some policemen. Aouda was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not understand. Passe-partout explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber. The young woman heart revolted against so heinous a charge, and when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector, she wept bitterly. As for Fix, he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty, whether Mr. Fogg was guilty or not. The thought then struck Passe-partout, that he was the cause of this new misfortune! Had he not concealed Fix errand from his master? When Fix revealed his true character and purpose, why had he not told Mr. Fogg? If the latter had been warned, he would no doubt have given Fix proof of his innocence, and satisfied him of his mistake; at least, Fix would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his master, only to arrest him the moment he set footon English soil. Passe-partout wept till he was blind, and felt like blowing his brains out. Aouda and he had remained, despite the cold, under the portico of the Custom House. Neither wished to leave the place; both were anxious to see Mr. Fogg again. That gentleman was really ruined, and that at the moment when he was about to attain his end. This arrest was fatal. Having arrived at Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December, he had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club, that is, nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to London was six hours. If anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he would have found Mr. Fogg seated, motionless, calm, and without apparent anger, upon a wooden bench. He was not, it is true, resigned; but this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion. Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages, all the more terrible because contained, and which only burst forth, with an irresistible force, at the last moment? No one could tell.'

नोकरी मिळवणे आणि शिक्षणाला अनुरूप अशी नोकरी मिळवणे, हे आव्हानच असते. नोकरी करणाऱ्यांचा बहूतेक वेळ हा कार्यालयातच जातो. तुमचे स्वत:चे कार्यालय असल्यास त्या कार्यालयातील कर्मचाऱ्यांकडून आपल्याला अपेक्षित असे काम किंवा उत्पादन करून घ्यायचे असल्यास कार्यालयात काही सुधारणा करणे अपेक्षित आहे. यासांठी काही उपयुक्त सूचना सर्वप्रथम कार्यालय प्रसन्न ठेवण्याकडे लक्ष द्यावे. कार्यालयात स्वच्छता असावी.
कर्मचाऱ्यांच्या सुख-दु:खात सक्रिय सहभाग असावा, त्याच्या
अडचणी समजून सोडवण्याचा प्रयत्न करावा. कार्यालयात एखादे संगीत लावावे. या शिवाय कार्यालयात प्रत्येक कर्मचाऱ्याचे अभिवादन स्वीकारताना त्यालाही शुभेच्छा देऊन त्याची जुजबी चौकशी करून मगच आपल्या खोलीत प्रवेश करावा.
आदल्या दिवशी दुसऱ्या दिवशीच्या कामाचे नियोजन करून त्याची
प्रत प्रत्येक कर्मचाऱ्याच्या टेबलावर ठेवल्यास त्याच्या कार्याचे मोजमाप घेता येईल. बारीक-सारीक चुका त्यांना न रागावता त्यांच्या पदरात कशा टाकता येतील याकडे लक्ष द्यायला हवे. कर्मचाऱ्यांमध्ये विविध स्पर्धा आयोजित केल्यास त्यांच्या वरील शीण दूर होउ शकतो.



मी एक भारतीय आहे. माझे माझ्या देशाबद्दल अतिशय सुंदर व मनोहर स्वप्न आहे. माझ्या भारतीय असण्याबद्दल मला अभिमान आहे. मला माझ्या देशाला पूर्वीचेच प्राचीन वैभव प्राप्त करून द्यायचे आहे. माझ्या देशाने सर्व जगाला ज्ञान व संस्कृतीचा संदेश द्यावा असे मला वाटते. माझ्या देशाने आपल्या सर्व शेजारी देशांना मदत करावी व शांतीचा संदेश द्यावा. जगाचे नेतृत्व करावे.
माझ्या स्वप्नातील भारत आर्थिकदृष्ट्या स्वयंपूर्ण असेल. येथे लहान मोठ्या सर्व प्रकारच्या व्यवसायांना पूर्ण स्वातंत्र्य असेल व समान सोयी उपलब्ध असतील. माझ्या स्वप्नातील भारतात निरक्षरता अजिबात नसेल व असे शिक्षण दिले जाईल. की प्रत्येकजण स्वतः पुरते कमवू शकेल. कोणीही गरीब, भिकारी किंवा उपाशी रहाणार नाही. प्रत्येकासाठी काम असेल. स्त्री शिक्षणावर विशेष भार दिला जाईल.
शरीर निरोगी असेल तर मन ही निरोगी असते. म्हणून देशातील प्रत्येक खेड्यात, गावात चांगली इस्पितळे व सर्व प्रकारच्या वैद्यकिय सोयी उपलब्ध असतील. देशाचे नागरिक निरोगी असतील तर सहाजिकच देशाच्या प्रगतीत ते सहभागी होऊ शकतील. माझ्या देशातून जातीयता, अस्पृश्यता जाती-भेद पूर्णपणे हद्दपार झालेले असतील.
देशात मैत्रीभाव सुखशांती नांदेल स्त्रियांवर अत्याचार होणार नाहीत व त्यांना समान संधी मिळतील.



रेल्वेचा प्रवास हा सर्वात मजेदार व आरामदायक प्रवास असतो. यातून आपल्याला वेगवेगळ्या प्रांतातील समाजातील लोकांशी जवळून संबंध येतो व वेगवेगळी ठिकाणे पहाता येतात. यामुळे रेल्वेने प्रवास करणे मला अतिशय आवडते. माझा पहिला रेल्वे प्रवास तर मी कधीही विसरू शकणार नाही वडिलांच्या मित्राच्या मुलाचे लग्न दिल्लीला असल्याने आम्ही मुंबईहून दिल्लीला गेलो होतो. मी तेव्हा सहावीत होते. आमचा प्रवास जवळ-जवळ वीस तासांचा होता. आम्ही राजधानी एक्सप्रेसने तेथे गेलो. ही पूर्णपणे वातानूकलित प्रवास गाडी आहे व त्यात सर्व सुखसोयी आहेत.
माझ्या वडिलांनी मला सांगितले की सर्वप्रथम आपल्याला तिकीटे आरक्षित करावी लागतील. मी ही त्यांच्यासोबत स्टेशनवर गेले. तिकीट खिडकीसमोर मोठी रांग होती. पाच तासानंतर आम्हाला आमची तिकीटे मिळाली. आम्हाला आणखी दोन महिन्यांनी निघायचे होते. मला तर कधी एकदाचे ट्रेनमध्ये बसेन असे झाले होते.
मी आमच्या प्रवासाच्या तारखेच्या आठवडाभर आधीच माझे सामान तयार ठेवले होते. अखेर तो दिवस उगवला, आम्ही गाडीच्या वेळेच्या एक तास आधी स्टेशनवर पोहोचलो. मला खुपच उत्सुकता होती. ट्रेन आल्याबरोबर मी आत चढले. आम्ही आमच्या सीट शोधल्या व आमचे सर्व सामान बाकांखाली रचले.



उत्पादन कशाचे करावे हा प्रश्न प्रामुख्याने मागणीप्रमाणे उत्पादन करण्यासाठी लागणाऱ्या साधनसामग्रीचा तुटवडा असल्यास निर्माण होतो. एखादा देश सर्वच वस्तू उत्पादन करू शकत नाही. कधी कधी देशाला हवे असलेले उत्पादन करण्यात साधनसामग्रीच्या तुटवड्यामुळे अडचणी निर्माण होतात. अशा वेळी कशाचे उत्पादन करावे या विषयीचा निर्णय त्या त्या देशाच्या आर्थिक स्थितीवर ठरतो.
हा प्रश्न तसा विकसनशील देशांच्या दृष्टीने अधिक महत्वाचा आहे. अशा देशांमध्ये भांडवलाची, तंत्रज्ञानाची कमतरता किंवा कुशल श्रमशक्तीचा अभाव असतो. त्यामुळे या देशांच्या उत्पादनक्षमतेवर मर्यादा पडतात. जेव्हा अमर्यादित गरजा आणि मर्यादित उत्पादन साधने असतात तेव्हा
उत्पादन कशाचे करावे हे समजण अधिक किचकट होते. अशा वेळी सर्वसामान्य गरजांना प्राधान्य देऊन त्या भागवणे हे सर्वात योग्य ठरते. सर्वात प्रथम अन्न, वस्त्र, विवारा आणि इतर उपभोग्य वस्तूंचे उत्पादन वाढवून मग नंतर सुखद आणि चैनीच्या वस्तूंचे उत्पादन मर्यादित केले पाहिजे. यामुळे जपुऱ्या साधनसामग्रीचा प्राधान्यक्रमानुसार उपयोग केला जातो. श्रीमंत देशात मुबलक साधनसामग्री असते परंतु श्रमशक्तीचा अभाव असतो.`;

    `महाराष्ट्राच्या आधुनिक इतिहासात, काही परिवर्तनकारी घटना आणि घटक आपली सामाजिक-राजकीय दृष्टीकोनात आढळून गेली आहेत. एक महत्वाचं क्षण होतं साम्युक्त महाराष्ट्र आंदोलन, भारतातील राज्यांच्या भाषांतर नियोजनाची मागणी करणारं एक जनआंदोलन. हा आंदोलन, केशवराव जेधे, एसएम जोशी, आणि प्रबोधांकर ठाकरेंच्या सर्वांगीन प्रयत्नांच्या द्वारे आणि समर्थनाने आढळलेला होता. यातील मुख्य उद्दीष्ट एक विशेष मराठी बोलण्याच्या राज्याच्या रचनेचं होतं. त्यांच्या प्रयत्नांचा परिणाम झाला, आणि १ मे १९६० ला महाराष्ट्र याची स्थापना झाली, ज्याची मुख्यधनं मुंबई असलेलं. हा घटना भारताच्या संघीयतेच्या आणि भाषांच्या विविधतेच्या आधारावर एक महत्वाचा साक्षी ठरवला, ज्याने राष्ट्रीय परंपरेतील भाषांच्या राज्यांचं गठनाचं प्रमाण सापडलं.महाराष्ट्राच्या स्थापना नंतर, राज्यात उद्योगीकरण आणि शहरीकरणाची वेगवेगळी अवधारणा होती, विशेषत: मुंबई, पुणे, आणि नाशिक या क्षेत्रांत. आर्थिक क्षमता म्हणजे मुंबई, वित्तीय नागरिकत्व चढावं करण्याचा मुख्य केंद्र, ज्यामुळे राष्ट्रांतर आणि विदेशातून धन आणि निवेश आले. या नगराचे आणि अतिरिक्त महाराष्ट्राच्या विकासात योगदानाचे विकासात लोकांचं योगदान महत्वाचं असलं.अधिकाराने, महाराष्ट्रानंतर भारताच्या स्वातंत्र्याच्या आंदोलनात, नेते जसे की बाळ गंगाधर टिळक, गोपाळ कृष्ण गोखले, आणि बी.आर्. अंबेडकर, ह्या क्षेत्रातून आलेले होते. त्यांचं बुद्धिजीवन आणि सामाजिक-राजकारणीचे काम लाखों लोकांचं प्रेरणा दिलं आणि भारताच्या लोकशाहीसाठी आधार ठरविले.स्वतंत्रतेनंतर, महाराष्ट्रानंतर राजकीय पक्षांचे सर्वांगीन उदय झाले, जसे की शिवसेना आणि राष्ट्रवादी कॉंग्रेस पक्ष, भारतीय राष्ट्रवादी कॉंग्रेसच्या महानेतेंच्या बरोबर. आयडियलच्या मोकळ्यांना सोडून, ह्या पक्षांनी राज्याच्या प्रशासनाच्या आणि धोरणांच्या परिप्रेक्ष्यात लोकशाहीच्या व अर्थव्यवस्थेच्या मार्गांना प्रभावित केले आणि त्यांच्या विकासाच्या आणि सामाजिक कल्याणाच्या पथावर आधार ठरवले.सोबत, महाराष्ट्र येथील सामाजिक सुधारणा आंदोलनांचा घर करण्याचा एक क्रांतिकारी उदाहरण आहे, ज्यात नारींचे हक्क, शिक्षण आणि जातीय समानता अशा कार्यांवर बल दिला जातो. ज्योतिराव फुले आणि सावित्रीबाई फुलें असंख्य जनांना सामाजिक न्यायाच्या संघर्षात सामील केले आणि अशा उदाहरणांचे त्यांचं उत्साह स्वातंत्र्ययुद्धानंतर लोकांना नव्या मार्गांनी प्रेरित केले.आता, महाराष्ट्राच्या आधुनिक इतिहासातील एक प्रमुख माध्यम आहे भारताच्या राजकीय परिस्थितीतील काही तबदले, ज्यांची सामाजिक व आर्थिक प्रक्रिया आणि राजकीय नेतृत्वाच्या बदलांच्या धडाक्यामुळे होती.महाराष्ट्र इतिहासातील एक महत्वाचं वळण आहे छत्रपती शिवाजी महाराजांच्या काळात. त्यांच्या काळात, महाराष्ट्र विविध राज्यांच्या हातात होतं, परंतु शिवाजी महाराजांच्या उत्तम शासनाने ह्या क्षेत्राची स्वातंत्र्याची संधी लाभली. त्यांनी छत्रपती शिवाजी महाराजांची संघर्षविरामी आणि क्षमाशीलतेवर आधारित शासनकाळ असल्यामुळे त्याचे काळ त्यांच्या शासनाच्या उत्कृष्टतेचा एक उजळ उदाहरण आहे.शिवाजी महाराजांच्या शासनकाळात, राज्याच्या संरक्षणासाठी संघर्ष करणारे अशा अनेक शूर सर्वांच्या स्मरणात आले जातात. त्यांचे सैन्यक्रम, त्यांच्या विजेत्यांचे उत्तम संघर्ष, आणि राज्याच्या स्थापनेकरिता केलेले परिणामकारक योगदान ह्यांच्यावर उचलील्या समृद्ध महाराष्ट्राचा उदय होता.इतिहासात, महाराष्ट्राचा आजारी राज्य होता. इ.स. १७१८ मध्ये बाजीराव पेशव्यांनी आणि ब्रिटिश सरकारच्या सोडल्या साथी केलेल्या तांबखोरा संधीमुळे मराठा साम्राज्याचे पराभव झाले. या पराभवानंतर महाराष्ट्रात राज्यप्रमुख म्हणून ब्रिटिश साम्राज्याचे कार्यकर्ते नियुक्त केले. ब्रिटिशांनी मराठा साम्राज्याच्या अधिकाराच्या बळीचा वापर केला आणि त्यामुळे या क्षेत्रातील आर्थिक विकासाचा वेग थांबला.ब्रिटिश साम्राज्यानंतरही, महाराष्ट्राच्या इतिहासात वेगवेगळी घडणींची मजलेची असू शकते. पूना गांधीजींच्या स्वराज्य संग्रामाने एक प्रमुख स्थान गाठला. या क्षेत्रात विविध आंदोलने झाल्या, जसे कि साम्यवादी संघटना, समाजवादी आंदोलने, आणि सामाजिक न्यायाच्या मुद्द्यांसाठी लढणारे आंदोलन. महाराष्ट्राच्या स्वातंत्र्य चळवळीच्या नंतर, राज्याचा आर्थिक विकास ही प्रमुख मागणी बनली.आज, महाराष्ट्र हे भारताच्या सर्वांत मोठ्या आणि समृद्ध राज्यांपैकी एक आहे. मुंबई, भारताच्या आर्थिक राजधानी म्हणून मान्यता असलेलं एक अत्यंत महत्त्वाचं नगर आहे. पुणे आणि नाशिक यांच्या प्रमुख शहरांत विज्ञान, प्रौद्योगिकी, आणि वैज्ञानिक अभ्यासांचा एक महत्त्वाचा केंद्र आहे. शिक्षण, कला, सांस्कृतिक क्रीडा, आणि वित्तीय सेवा हे सर्व क्षेत्र महाराष्ट्रात विकसित आहेत.महाराष्ट्राच्या सांस्कृतिक विविधतेमुळे ह्या प्रदेशातील लोक केवळ समाजशास्त्र, कला, संगीत, वाणी, खाद्यसंस्कृती, विभिन्न धर्म, आणि सांस्कृतिक विरासतींच्या अभ्यासात लोकांची समृद्धता दिसते. अशा प्रकारे, महाराष्ट्र एक विविध, समृद्ध, आणि प्रगतिशील प्रदेश म्हणून ओळखले जाते.`,
